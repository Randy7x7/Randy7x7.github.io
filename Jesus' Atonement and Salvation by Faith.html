    <h1>Jesus' Atonement and Salvation by Faith</h1>
    <main>
      <h1 id="jesus">Jesus</h1>
<h3 id="jesus-is-fully-human">Jesus is fully human</h3>
<p><strong>Jesus was a flesh and blood human being.  He was the son of Mary.</strong>  Mary provided 23 of His chromosomes and God provided the father’s half of His chromosomes.  <strong>He was literally the son of God, because God provided the father’s half of His chromosomes.</strong>  He was born as a baby.  <strong>He had to slowly learn to walk and talk, and He interacted as a child with His parents all of the years He was growing up.</strong></p>

<p>When He travelled with His disciples as an adult, His Mother and brothers sometimes came with Him. ()  Jesus appears to have had a close personal friendship with Mary, Martha, and their brother. ()  <strong>When Jesus was in the garden of gethsemane just before He went to the cross, He asked God in prayer if there was any way out of it, even though He knew there wasn’t.  This sounds very human.</strong> ()</p>
<h3 id="jesus-relationship-with-god-the-father">Jesus’ Relationship with God the Father</h3>
<p><strong>Jesus said that the Father is greater than Him, so Jesus is distinct from the Father and lesser than Him.</strong> (John 14:28)  <strong>We see this distinctness again in the garden of gethsemane, just before Jesus was taken to be crucified.</strong>  In Luke 22:42, Jesus prayed, “<strong>yet not My will, but Yours be done.</strong>”  <strong>Jesus and the Father had distinct wills at this time, so they were clearly different people!</strong>  Jesus submitted His will to the Father’s will, because the Father is greater.</p>

<p><strong>Luke 22:41-42:</strong></p>
<h5 id="41-and-he-withdrew-from-them-about-a-stones-throw-and-he-knelt-down-and-began-to-pray-42-saying-father-if-you-are-willing-remove-this-cup-from-me-yet-not-my-will-but-yours-be-done">41 And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and began to pray, 42 saying, <strong>“Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.”</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Although Jesus and the Father were distinct, they were nevertheless one!  How can this be?  It’s less of a mystery than it sounds like.  The bible gives sufficient evidence to mostly understand it.</strong>  Although the evidence is clear, it’s somewhat complicated.  <strong>John 14 is a good place to start.</strong>  <strong>John 14 took place during the last supper, the same evening Jesus was taken to be crucified.</strong></p>

<p>Most people have difficulty understanding John 14, but it is worth the effort needed to understand it.  It’s the key to understanding many of the things that puzzle people about the bible.  If you can understand John 14, the rest of the new testament will make good sense to you.</p>

<p><strong>John 14</strong>:</p>
<h5 id="1-do-not-let-your-heart-be-troubled-believe-in-god-believe-also-in-me-2-in-my-fathers-house-are-many-dwelling-places-if-it-were-not-so-i-would-have-told-you-for-i-go-to-prepare-a-place-for-you-3-if-i-go-and-prepare-a-place-for-you-i-will-come-again-and-receive-you-to-myself-that-where-i-am-there-you-may-be-also-4-and-you-know-the-way-where-i-am-going-5-thomas-said-to-him-lord-we-do-not-know-where-you-are-going-how-do-we-know-the-way-6-jesus-said-to-him-i-am-the-way-and-the-truth-and-the-life-no-one-comes-to-the-father-but-through-me">1 “Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me. 2 In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. 3 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also. <strong>4 And you know the way where I am going.” 5  Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?” 6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.</strong></h5>

<h5 id="7-if-you-had-known-me-you-would-have-known-my-father-also-from-now-on-you-know-him-and-have-seen-him"><strong>7 If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him.”</strong></h5>

He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10 <em>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. 11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me;</em></strong> otherwise believe because of the works themselves. 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father. 13 Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.</h5>

<p>Jesus said in verse 9, <strong>“He who has seen Me has seen the Father.”</strong>  He explained this in verse 10-11 by saying, <strong>“Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.</strong>  Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me”</p>

<p><strong>The meaning of this passage depends on the meaning of two statements.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The Father is in Jesus because the Holy Spirit is in Jesus.  John the Baptist said in John 3:34 that the Father gave Jesus the Spirit without measure.  The Holy Spirit in Jesus teaches Him and tells Him what to say and do.</p>

<p>Jesus is in the Father because Jesus is part of the Father’s body here on earth.  Jesus did everything on earth the Father told Him to do, just like our bodies do everything we tell them to do.  Jesus is in the Father because He is in the Father’s body.</p>

<p>Jesus said similar things <strong>about us and himself</strong> in the passage below!  <strong>Jesus said that He will be in us and we will be in Him!  The relationship Jesus has with the Father is similar to the relationship we as Christians have with Jesus &amp; the Father.</strong>  When we understand the relationship of Christians with Jesus, we will understand better Jesus’ relationship with the Father.</p>

Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful. 28 You heard that I said to you, ‘I go away, and I will come to you.’ <strong>If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.</strong> 29 Now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. 30 I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me; 31 but <strong>so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me.</strong> Get up, let us go from here.</h5>

<p>The word translated “Helper” in verse 16 is the Greek word <strong>“Paraclete”</strong>, which was the Greek word for lawyer.  In ancient Greece, your lawyer did not speak for you in court.  He stood beside you and whispered in your ear what you were to say or do.  <strong>This is the metaphor Jesus chose for the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit whispers to us what to say and do.  He guides us and teaches us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Holy Spirit tells Jesus what to do, and Jesus always does it.</strong>  John the Baptist said the Father gives Jesus the Spirit without measure. (John 3:34)  <strong>Therefore, the Father is in Jesus telling Him what to do.  Jesus always says and does what the Father tells Him to do, so Jesus is part of the Father’s body.</strong>  Jesus is in the Father.  <strong>The words Jesus spoke and the things He did came from the Father.</strong>  By watching Jesus and listening to Him, one can see what the Father is doing and hear what He is saying.  <strong>Jesus and the Father are one, even though they are separate people!</strong>  Love does that to people!</p>

<p><strong>Christians are to be led by the Holy Spirit, and do what the Spirit tells them to do, functioning as part of the body of Christ.</strong>  Christians are to be one with Jesus in the same way Jesus is one with the Father.</p>

<p><strong>Re-read John 14 with this understanding.  It should mostly make sense now.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are two ways in which Jesus is very different from us.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>He is biologically the son of God!</strong>  The Father provided half of His chromosomes.  Christians are sons and daughters of God, but Jesus is the only <strong>begotten</strong> son of God.  <strong>Rom 8:29 says that Jesus is the first born among many brethren.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jesus is somehow the same as the pre-existent Word</strong> which the Apostle John referred to in John 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have discussed the first of these two ways Jesus is unique, but not the second.  <strong>Now we will discuss the pre-existent Christ, and how Jesus can be fully human and yet also the pre-existent Word.</strong>  Let’s start by looking at scriptures describing the pre-existent Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Gen 1:26</strong>:</p>
<h5 id="then-god-said-let-us-make-man-in-our-image-according-to-our-likeness---">Then God said, “Let <strong>Us</strong> make man in <strong>Our</strong> image, according to <strong>Our</strong> likeness; . . .</h5>

<p><strong>Col 1:15-20</strong>:</p>
<h5 id="15-he-is-the-image-of-the-invisible-god-the-firstborn-of-all-creation-16-for-by-him-all-things-were-created-both-in-the-heavens-and-on-earth-visible-and-invisible-whether-thrones-or-dominions-or-rulers-or-authoritiesall-things-have-been-created-through-him-and-for-him-17-he-is-before-all-things-and-in-him-all-things-hold-together-18-he-is-also-head-of-the-body-the-church-and-he-is-the-beginning-the-firstborn-from-the-dead-so-that-he-himself-will-come-to-have-first-place-in-everything-19-for-it-was-the-fathers-good-pleasure-for-all-the-fullness-to-dwell-in-him-20-and-through-him-to-reconcile-all-things-to-himself-having-made-peace-through-the-blood-of-his-cross-through-him-i-say-whether-things-on-earth-or-things-in-heaven">15  He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. 16 <strong>For  by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible,</strong> whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—<strong>all things have been created through Him and for Him.</strong> 17 He  is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. 18 He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything. 19 For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, 20 and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.</h5>

<p><strong>John 1:1-18</strong>​:</p>

<p><strong>John 17:1-5</strong>:​</p>

<p><strong>These scriptures tell us clearly that, somehow or other, Jesus existed before He was born as a human being!</strong>  They also tell us that <strong>the pre-existent Jesus created everything around us, and even created us!  They say that God the Father created things through Jesus instead of directly.</strong>  Recall that Gen 1:26 says “Then God said, “Let <strong>Us</strong> make man in <strong>Our</strong> image, according to <strong>Our</strong> likeness.”  <strong>Creation was a joint project, with God the Father working through Jesus.</strong></p>

<p>We’ve already looked at evidence that Jesus in the flesh was extremely human. <strong>Jesus’ genuine humanness is a key part of His atonement for our sins, which we will discuss shortly.</strong>  <strong>How could Jesus be a genuine human being, and yet also be the super intelligent all powerful creator of the world?</strong>  How could Jesus have existed long before the earth existed?</p>

<p><strong>These are questions which we cannot answer definitively.  We don’t have the knowledge needed; the bible doesn’t tell us.</strong>  Although we don’t know how this was done, <strong>there is one kind of obvious guess we can make.  God could have just given the human Jesus some memories from the pre-existing Jesus.</strong><br />
<strong>The memories would have to have been simplified so that a merely human mind could comprehend them.</strong>  They would also have to have been extremely abbreviated, because of the incomprehensible amount of detail involved in creating an entire world!</p>

<p><strong>Jesus could have these amazing memories, and yet still be 100% human.  When He died on the cross, He was an entirely genuine human being making this sacrifice for the rest of humanity.</strong></p>
<h3 id="atonement">Atonement</h3>
<p><strong>How can Jesus’ death on the cross pay the penalty for my sin?</strong>  The first thing to notice is that although everyone’s sin is potentially forgiven, only some people’s sin is actually forgiven.  <strong>Only people who come to Jesus and believe in Him are saved.</strong>  (John 3:16)</p>

<p><strong>John 3:14-21</strong>:</p>
<h5 id="14-as-moses-lifted-up-the-serpent-in-the-wilderness-even-so-must-the-son-of-man-be-lifted-up-15-so-that-whoever-believes-will-in-him-have-eternal-life--16-for-god-so-loved-the-world-that-he-gave-his-only-begotten-son-that-whoever-believes-in-him-shall-not-perish-but-have-eternal-life-17-for-god-did-not-send-the-son-into-the-world-to-judge-the-world-but-that-the-world-might-be-saved-through-him-18-he-who-believes-in-him-is-not-judged-he-who-does-not-believe-has-been-judged-already-because-he-has-not-believed-in-the-name-of-the-only-begotten-son-of-god-19-this-is-the-judgment-that-the-light-has-come-into-the-world-and-men-loved-the-darkness-rather-than-the-light-for-their-deeds-were-evil-20-for-everyone-who-does-evil-hates-the-light-and-does-not-come-to-the-light-for-fear-that-his-deeds-will-be-exposed-21-but-he-who-practices-the-truth-comes-to-the-light-so-that-his-deeds-may-be-manifested-as-having-been-wrought-in-god">14 As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; 15 <strong>so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.</strong>  16 <strong>For God so loved the world, that He gave His  only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. 18 He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</strong> 19 This is the judgment, that <strong>the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21 But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Verse 16 says that whoever believes in Jesus will have eternal life.  Verses 17-18 say that whoever believes in Jesus will not be judged.</strong>  Verses 19-21 say that people who do not come to Him are staying away because they don’t want their sins to be revealed, so they deserve judgment.  Jesus’ miracles and the manifest rightness of His teaching would otherwise have drawn them to Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>The promises in verses 16-18 sound too good to be true.</strong>  This is because most modern people misinterpret the word “believes” in a Christian context.  <strong>They fail to give the word “believes” its full meaning.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Believing in Jesus, or having faith in Him, means trusting Him and believing the things He says.  This requires believing He exists and believing He is the son of God, but it also requires much more.</strong>  If I believe in my plumber, it means I believe he is a capable plumber.  It also means I believe he will do a good job on my pipes and charge me fairly.</p>

<p><strong>If a wife believes in her husband, or has faith in him, it means she believes he is capable, wise, and good.  It also means she believes he loves her and will do whatever is best for her.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I believe in Jesus, or have faith in Jesus, it means I believe all of the things He says.  It also means I believe He is wise and good.  If I have faith in Jesus, it means I believe He loves me and will do what is best for me.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I have this kind of faith in Jesus, I will naturally try hard to do the things He says to do.  I will also try hard to think and be the way He says I should think and be.</strong>  Jesus is a teacher, and belief in a teacher is shown by doing what he teaches me to do.</p>

<p><strong>God gives eternal life to people who have faith in Jesus because they naturally love Him and try hard to do the things He says to do.</strong>  They are good on both the inside and the outside!</p>

<p><strong>This definition of believes makes sense of John 3:36, which otherwise seems self contradictory.</strong></p>

<p><strong>John 3:36</strong>:</p>
<h5 id="he-who-believes-in-the-son-has-eternal-life-but-he-who-does-not-obey-the-son-will-not-see-life-but-the-wrath-of-god-abides-on-him">He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</h5>

<p>G<strong>od fills people who have faith in Jesus with the Holy Spirit.</strong>  The Holy Spirit living in them teaches them, helps them, and offers them better desires.  <strong>People who are filled with the Holy Spirit have Christ in them by the Spirit just as Jesus has the Father in Him.  Since they have faith they try hard to do the things Jesus tells them to do.  They are part of the body of Christ.</strong></p>

<p><strong>People who have faith in Jesus are one with Jesus as Jesus is one with the Father.  Since they are one with Jesus, it is natural that Jesus’ sacrifice can cover their sins!</strong></p>
<h3 id="scriptures-that-teach-the-way-of-salvation">Scriptures that Teach the Way of Salvation</h3>
<p><strong>The following scriptures teach that we are saved by having the kind of faith that leads to oneness with God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>John 15:1-11</strong>:</p>

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.</strong> 5 I am the vine, you are the branches; <strong>he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6 If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned.</strong> 7 <strong>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</strong> 8 My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so  prove to be My disciples. 9 Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love. 10 <strong>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.</strong> 11 These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.</h5>

<p><strong>This passage immediately follows the John 14 passage we looked at earlier.  Jesus said in John 14 that He will give us the Holy Spirit if we love Him and therefore keep His commandments.</strong>  He said that if we love Him and keep His commandments He will be in us and we will be in Him.</p>

<p><strong>Abiding in Jesus means continuing to be a part of His body.  This means  continuing to listen to what He says by the Holy Spirit and His recorded word, and continuing to do the things He says to do.</strong>  Jesus says in John 15 that we must <strong>continue</strong> to love Him and keep His commandments, <strong>or we will start walking into the darkness instead of the light and will be lost!</strong>  To do the things He says, we must listen to what He says by His Spirit and we must recall the things He taught in the written word.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus warns us in John 15 that salvation is a continuing process instead of a one time event.</strong>  We must <strong>continue</strong> to listen to what the Holy Spirit and the written word say, and try hard to do it, or we will walk into the darkness and be lost.  <strong>The gathering up of dead branches and throwing them into the fire takes place at the end of the age instead of immediately. (Mat 13:24-30, the wheat and the tares)</strong>  They are already dead spiritually.</p>

<p><strong>The people who continue to listen to the Holy Spirit and remember Jesus’ written words, and who try to do them, are the people who have faith in Jesus.</strong>  It is really the faith that matters, not the good deeds, but the good deeds are a reliable indicator of who has faith in Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Gal 5:16-25 (NLT)</strong>:</p>
<h5 id="16-so-i-say-let-the-holy-spirit-guide-your-lives-then-you-wont-be-doing-what-your-sinful-nature-craves-17-the-sinful-nature-wants-to-do-evil-which-is-just-the-opposite-of-what-the-spirit-wants-and-the-spirit-gives-us-desires-that-are-the-opposite-of-what-the-sinful-nature-desires-these-two-forces-are-constantly-fighting-each-other-so-you-are-not-free-to-carry-out-your-good-intentions-18-but-when-you-are-directed-by-the-spirit-you-are-not-under-obligation-to-the-law-of-moses">16 <strong>So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves. 17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants.</strong> And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions. 18 But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.</h5>

<p>Gal 5:16-25 is fairly self explanatory.  <strong>If we listen to the Holy Spirit and obey, we will end up filled with love, joy, peace, etc.</strong>  <strong>We will inherit the kingdom of God.</strong>  <strong>If we ignore the voice of the Holy Spirit and do not obey, we will end up filled with darkness and will not inherit the kingdom of God.</strong>  We will have separated ourselves from Jesus and his atonement for our sins.  <strong>How much faith we have in Jesus will determine which way we choose.</strong></p>

Father!” 16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Rom 7:18-20 says that we are unable to live righteously without the help of the Holy Spirit.</strong>  We are slaves to sin.  Rom 8:2 and 8:4-8 say that <strong>people who set their attention on the desires the Holy Spirit gives can be righteous; they become filled with the fruit of the Spirit.</strong>  The word translated flesh in Rom 8-9 is sarx, which means the natural mind and body.  <strong>Being led by the Spirit is the same thing as abiding in Christ.  You are listening to the Spirit and obeying.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rom 8:14 says that those who are being led by the Spirit are the sons of God.  Rom 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit Himself testifies to us that we are children of God!</strong>  The children of God are the people who will inherit the kingdom of God.  They will receive eternal life.</p>
<h3 id="strong-heart-faith-in-jesus">Strong Heart Faith in Jesus</h3>
<p><strong>How strong a Christian you are depends much more on the strength of your faith than on how much you know!</strong>  There are a few basic facts you need to know, but after that your strength as a Christian is determined mostly by how much faith you have instead of how much you know.</p>

<p><strong>Strong faith must live in your heart instead of just your head.  You must believe all of Jesus’s promises in your heart.  You must believe in your heart that you really must do all of the things Jesus said to do.</strong>  If you believe Jesus’ promises and commands in your heart, then you will act on them in your everyday life.  <strong>If you believe all of Jesus’ promises and commands firmly in your heart, then you will live a very Christian life and be a very strong Christian.</strong>  Christ will be in you and you will be in Christ.  You will be filled strongly with His Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>A little bit of psychology is useful for understanding the difference between head knowledge and heart knowledge.  <strong>A human being can think in any of his or her sensory channels.</strong>  You can think in words.  verbal thoughts are words passing through your mind.</p>

<p><strong>You can also think in images (videos).  Visualize walking from your bedroom to your kitchen and getting a glass of cold water without thinking in words.  How would it look different if you were getting hot water.  Include putting your finger in the stream of water first and checking the temperature.  This adds a non visual sensory channel to your little “video”.</strong>  Actually feel the warmth or coldness of the water on your finger as you imagine this activity.  <strong>Feelings of warmth, pressure, etcetera in your body are sensory channels.</strong>  Imagine tossing a ball back and forth with a friend.  Feel the ball as it hits your hand.  Sense the feel in your arm as you throw it.</p>

<p>Most of a person’s thinking is not verbal.  Most of our thinking is multisensory and non-verbal.  <strong>Imagine walking up to the edge of a cliff without allowing any verbal thoughts in your head.  You have very strong nonverbal beliefs about what will happen if you step off the edge.</strong>  You also have <strong>very strong emotional reactions to these experiences</strong> which are not mediated by words.</p>

<p><strong>Most of our strongest beliefs and emotional reactions are stored and used non-verbally, independently of words.</strong>  These are the beliefs and emotional responses that govern our daily lives and most of our emotions.  We can also feel our emotions, so they are sensory channel.  Notice your emotions as you imagine stepping up to the edge of a cliff.</p>

<p><strong>Only a small portion of your brain is involved in processing words.  Head knowledge is knowledge stored and expressed in words.  Head knowledge is extremely shallow and often does not have much effect on our actions and emotions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strong faith is faith that penetrates deep into the heart, and is believed with a high degree of certainty.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suppose you read a passage in the bible.</strong>  Do you really really believe it is true, or is your relationship to it tentative.  <strong>Do you even process it and store it in non-verbal forms that are likely to influence your actions and emotions?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you try doing this, does the non-verbal part of your mind believe it, or is your belief merely verbal?  Make up little stories about yourself and others related to the passage.  This is what’s meant by meditating on a scripture passage.</strong>  When you meditate, you <strong>think about it in non-verbal ways and decide whether the non-verbal part of you believes it.  Does the non-verbal part of you believe it in some circumstances but not in others?</strong></p>

<p>**Most Christians don’t really believe very much of the bible in their hearts.  What belief they have is mostly just verbal.  Consequently, their “beliefs” don’t really effect their actions and emotions very much.  It’s doubtful that a level of faith that does not effect your actions or emotions much is sufficient to receive the promises Jesus gave to those who “believe” in Him.  Jesus made it clear at the end of the sermon on the mount and in John 14 that our faith must be strong enough to change our actions.</p>
