    <h1>Loving People</h1>
    <main>
      <p><strong>The heart of the bible’s moral teaching is that we should love God with all our hearts and love our neighbors as ourselves.</strong></p>
<h4 id="mat-2234-40"><strong>Mat 22:34-40</strong></h4>
<h5 id="34-but-when-the-pharisees-heard-that-jesus-had-silenced-the-sadducees-they-gathered-themselves-together-35-one-of-them-a-lawyer-asked-him-a-question-testing-him-36-teacher-which-is-the-great-commandment-in-the-law-37-and-he-said-to-him--you-shall-love-the-lord-your-god-with-all-your-heart-and-with-all-your-soul-and-with-all-your-mind-38-this-is-the-great-and-foremost-commandment-39-the-second-is-like-it-you-shall-love-your-neighbor-as-yourself-40-on-these-two-commandments-depend-the-whole-law-and-the-prophets">34  But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together. 35 One of them,  a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, 36 <strong>“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” 37 And He said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the great and foremost commandment. 39 The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.”</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Jesus said that all of the law and prophets are based on the importance of loving God and loving our neighbors as ourselves.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1 Cor 13 says that I am nothing unless I genuinely love other people in my heart.  Verses 4-7 describe the nature of genuine love.</strong></p>

<h4 id="1-cor-131-7"><strong>1 Cor 13:1-7</strong></h4>
<h5 id="1-if-i-speak-with-the-tongues-of-men-and-of-angels-but-do-not-have-love-i-have-become-a-noisy-gong-or-a-clanging-cymbal-2-if-i-have-the-gift-of-prophecy-and-know-all-mysteries-and-all-knowledge-and-if-i-have-all-faith-so-as-to-remove-mountains-but-do-not-have-love-i-am-nothing-3-and-if-i-give-all-my-possessions-to-feed-the-poor-and-if-i-surrender-my-body-to-be-burned-but-do-not-have-love-it-profits-me-nothing"><strong>1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</strong> 2 If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 And <strong>if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.</strong></h5>
<h5 id="4-love-is-patient-love-is-kind-and-is-not-jealous-love-does-not-brag-and-is-not-arrogant-5-does-not-act-unbecomingly-it-does-not-seek-its-own-is-not-provoked-does-not-take-into-account-a-wrong-suffered-6-does-not-rejoice-in-unrighteousness-but-rejoices-with-the-truth-7-bears-all-things-believes-all-things-hopes-all-things-endures-all-things"><strong>4 Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, 5 does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, 6  does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; 7   bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</strong></h5>
<p>Verses 1-3 make it clear that <strong>loving people involves more than just actions!</strong>  God cares most about my heart and my motives, regardless of my actions.  <strong>Only my heart and motives really matter.</strong></p>

<p>Verses 4-7 show us how to distinguish real love from insufficient love!  <strong>All of us need to review 1 Cor 13:4-7 regularly, to see how we are doing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus expounded on the importance of loving people who are very different from us in Luke 10:25-37.</strong></p>

How does it read to you?” 27 And he answered, <strong>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”</strong> 28 And He said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.” <strong>29 But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Jesus made a Samaritan the hero of His story.</strong>  The Samaritans were hated and despised by the Jews, as religious enemies.  <strong>The modern equivalent would be Jesus making an Arab Muslim the hero, and a couple of Christian religious leaders the ones who failed to love the injured man.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The lawyer asked Jesus who was his neighbor, and Jesus implied that even the hated Samaritans are his neighbors.  He must love even the Samaritans!</strong>  The Samaritan loved his Jewish neighbor.  Verse 33 says that the Samaritan <strong>felt compassion</strong> for the injured Jewish man.</p>

<p><strong>It goes without saying that when you see someone from your own city is in trouble, he is your neighbor.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The parable of the Sheep and the goats, Mat 25;31-46, shows the importance of helping people in need.</strong>  This is often called a parable, but it’s not really a parable.  It’s a statement of fact which uses sheep and goats to represent good and bad people.</p>

<p><strong>I find this passage frightening!  Jesus said that my love for people who are in need, or my lack of love, will determine my eternal destiny!</strong></p>

<p>Jesus also said that whatever I do to the least of His brothers, I do to Him!  A Christian is a son of God, so he is a brother of Jesus.  Paul said that Jesus is the first born of many brethren. (Rom 8:29)  Jesus lives <strong>in</strong> every Christian by His Holy Spirit.  <strong>We are truly helping or not helping Jesus when we help or fail to help a brother in Christ.</strong></p>

<p>In the sermon on the mount, Jesus taught that <strong>we must love our enemies</strong> and must forgive everyone who sins against us.  He taught that we must love our enemies in <strong>Mat 5:38-48.</strong>  He taught that we must forgive everyone who has sinned against us in <strong>Mat 6:12, 6:14-15, and in  Mat 18:21-35.</strong>  <strong>It is worth while to go back to the sermon on the mount and review these teachings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Love, for friends and enemies alike, is universal in God’s kingdom.</strong>  As Christians, we must learn to be good citizens in His kingdom!  <strong>It’s not a matter of actions as much as it is a matter of heart.</strong>  With help from the Holy Spirit and from God’s discipline, we must acquire genuinely loving hearts.  <strong>Giving up our idolatries is a big part of this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Make up some stories that illustrate how idolatry can prevent us from loving people.</strong></p>
