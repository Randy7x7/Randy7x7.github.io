    <h1>Idolatry</h1>
    <main>
      <p><strong>I am guilty of  idolatry if I love something more than I love God.</strong>  <strong>Why is this such a bad thing?</strong>  Suppose I love my girlfriend more than I love having a close relationship with God.  If so, I will disobey God whenever He tells me to do something that may cause me to lose my girlfriend.  God is no longer my God. He is just someone who makes suggestions that I may or may not chose to obey.</p>

<p>Suppose I Iove status at my job more than I care what God says.  Then, I will disobey God to gain status at work.  <strong>Whatever I love most will control what I think and do.  Loving anything more than I love God will generally lead me to disobeying God.</strong></p>

The first one said to him, ‘I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.’ 19 Another one said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.’ 20 Another one said, ‘I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.’</strong> 21 And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’ 22 And the slave said, ‘Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’ 23 And the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled. <strong>24 For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.’”</strong></h5>

<p><strong>What were the idols that prevented people from coming to Jesus?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I want anything more than I want God, then eventually it will pull me away from Him.  If I want to be a disciple of Jesus, I need to consider now what I may eventually have to give up to continue following Him.  If there is anything I want more than God, then my discipleship may eventually come to an ignominious end.</strong>  I should count the cost now, and make up my mind before the test comes.</p>

<p><strong>Being a Christian is not a hobby.  If it’s not my life, then it’s an illusion!</strong></p>

<h5 id="11-but-when-the-king-came-in-to-look-over-the-dinner-guests-he-saw-a-man-there-who-was-not-dressed-in-wedding-clothes-12-and-he-said-to-him-friend-how-did-you-come-in-here-without-wedding-clothes-and-the-man-was-speechless-13-then-the-king-said-to-the-servants-bind-him-hand-and-foot-and-throw-him-into-the-outer-darkness-in-that-place-there-will-be-weeping-and-gnashing-of-teeth-14-for-many-are-called-but-few-are-chosen">11 “But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes, 12 and <strong>he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?’ And the man was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 14 For many are  called, but few are chosen.”</strong></h5>

<p>People did not have to bring their own wedding clothes.  The Groom supplied the wedding clothes.  Wearing the wedding clothes indicated respect for the bride and groom.  In this case, the wedding clothes probably represent righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>Many are called but few are chosen likely means that God calls many people to become His sons and daughters, but few come.  Even some of those who come do not put off their old selves and put on their new selves in Christ.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Eph 4:22-24</strong> says,”22 . . . in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, 23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24 and put on the new self, which  in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.”</p>

<p><strong>What are your most tempting idols?  What do you spend a lot of time on?</strong> 
Entertainment, Work, House &amp; Yard, Hobbies, Sports, Friends, Children, . . .</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any potential idols that are not on this list?</strong></p>

<p><strong>For many people, idolatry is a worse spiritual problem and harder to resist than any of the other things Jesus listed in the sermon on the mount!</strong>  We each need to spend time regularly asking God to help us see when we are caught up in an idolatry.</p>

<p><strong>Many times when I seem to be in a dry spell with the Lord, unable to feel His presence or think and behave well, it turns out to be because I have gotten caught up in some kind of idolatry.  When I discern and repent of the idolatry, the problem goes away immediately!</strong>  The problem of idolatry is that pervasive and that serious, for all of us.  <strong>Keep idolatry high on your list of things to watch out for and pray against.</strong>  Any time you seem to be spiritually weak, check for idolatry.</p>
