    <h1>Sermon on the Mount</h1>
    <main>
      <p><strong>The sermon on the mount is Jesus’ first recorded sermon, and His longest recorded sermon.</strong>  It’s recorded in Mat. 5-7.  Parts of it, spoken to a different group of people, are also recorded in Luke.</p>

<p>There was no radio, television, audio recording, newspapers, etc. in Jesus’ day.  <strong>When Jesus started teaching a new group of people, they would not already know His teaching.  He had to start from scratch every time.</strong>  The sermon on the mount may have been repeated, in one form or another, everywhere He went.</p>

<p><strong>Much of the sermon on the mount is about right and wrong ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.</strong>  Jesus teaches many of the principles of righteousness in the sermon on the mount.</p>

<p><strong>We will read the entire sermon on the mount</strong> and examine it in some detail.  It’s only three chapters long, and <strong>the principles it teaches are vitally important to learn well and take to heart.  The quality of one’s Christian life will depend greatly on trying hard to live by the principles taught in the sermon on the mount.</strong></p>

<h5 id="3-blessed-are-the-poor-in-spirit-for-theirs-is-the-kingdom-of-heaven">3 “ Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</h5>
<p>Christianity is a religion of dependence on God.  We need God to raise us from the dead when our physical bodies die.  God also provides our protection and provision in this life. (Mat 6:31-33, Mat 7:7-11)  We need God for the wisdom of how to lead a good and happy life.  We need God’s Holy Spirit to give us the power to live a good and happy life.  We believe we are needy, but God provides what we need.</p>

<p><strong>If I am not poor in spirit, I believe I already have everything I need, without God’s help.</strong>  If I am not poor in spirit, I am unlikely to enter into a dependent relationship with God.</p>

<p><strong>Do you feel like you need God?  What do you need God for??</strong></p>
<h5 id="4-blessed-are-those-who-mourn-for-they-shall-be-comforted">4 “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</h5>
<p>Jesus said that <strong>Satan is the ruler of this world!</strong> (John 14:30, 1 John 5:19)  <strong>Satan rules the world through people.</strong>  Satan suggests ideas to people in high places in government, the media, education, parents, etc.  He also suggests ideas to all people everywhere.   Satan is more clever than us, and He appeals to the appetites of our flesh and minds.  <strong>Enough people, in both high places and low places, believe and do the things Satan suggests that He effectively rules the world.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Because Satan rules the world, there is enormous misery and suffering in people’s lives.</strong>  Jesus promised us that God will comfort all who mourn their losses and suffering.</p>

<p><strong>Discuss this analysis of the world.</strong></p>

<p>The Apostle Paul spoke of this in Rom 8:18-39 .
<strong>Discuss this scripture passage.</strong></p>
<h5 id="5-blessed-are-the-gentle-for-they-shall-inherit-the-earth">5 “Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.</h5>
<p><strong>We will see shortly that Jesus puts heavy emphasis on loving people, truly loving them.</strong>  In Mat 22:37-40, Jesus said, “37 . . . “<em>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: <strong>‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’</strong> 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</em>
He insisted that we even love our enemies.  <strong>Loving people is, in most cases, being gentle with them instead of harsh and forceful.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are there places in your life where it is hard to be gentle with people?</strong></p>
<h5 id="6-blessed-are-those-who-hunger-and-thirst-for-righteousness-for-they-shall-be-satisfied">6 “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</h5>
<p><strong>God will establish His kingdom eventually, and His kingdom is filled with righteousness.</strong>  <strong>Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied when that happens.</strong>  Unrepentant sinners will not like it at all.  <strong>This beatitude is an encouragement to hunger and thirst for righteousness,</strong> not for unrighteousness.</p>

<p><strong>Do you hunger and thirst for righteousness?</strong></p>
<h5 id="7-blessed-are-the-merciful-for-they-shall-receive-mercy">7 “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus said very clearly in the Lord’s prayer and just after it that God will not forgive our sins if we don’t forgive the sins of other people.</strong> (Mat 6:12, 14-15) He also said the same thing in Mat 7:1-5.  This is extremely important to our spiritual growth!  Most people have no idea how extremely important this is.  <strong>Failure to forgive other people may well be the single most common reason that people never grow spiritually.</strong>  It is impossible to grow spiritually while holding unforgiveness in your heart!</p>

<p><strong>Can you think of anyone you have unforgiveness for?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pray and ask God to show you.</strong></p>

<p>You may tell yourself you’ve forgiven them, but just don’t like them.  You may say that you just resent them.  <strong>Check your heart.  Jesus said in Mat 18:35 that we must forgive from the heart!</strong>  This is critically important for your relationship with God. Unforgiveness is the opposite of love.</p>
<h5 id="8-blessed-are-the-pure-in-heart-for-they-shall-see-god">8 “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</h5>
<p>A pure heart is a heart filled with love for God and for <strong>all</strong> people.  A pure heart is a heart that is not spoiled by sinful passions, anger, or unforgiveness.  The goals of discipleship are to acquire faith in God and a pure heart.</p>

<p><strong>Ask yourself, are there things in my heart that are not pure?</strong>
Ask God to help you cleanse your heart, and then guard it.  The issues of your life flow out from your heart.  Your thoughts and actions are driven by what’s in your heart.  Many of your beliefs are a result of what is in your heart.</p>

<p><strong>Do you regularly take any steps to guard your heart?  please explain.</strong></p>
<h5 id="9-blessed-are-the-peacemakers-for-they-shall-be-called-sons-of-god">9 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</h5>
<p>People love each other in God’s kingdom.  Therefore <strong>God’s kingdom is a kingdom of peace.</strong>  Christians love peace, so they try to promote it.  Promoting peace thwarts the devil’s work.  <strong>Also, people often use deception and lies to cause other people to hate their enemies.</strong>  Deception and lies are the work of the devil, and should be opposed.</p>

<p><strong>Do you remember a time when you tried to be a peace maker?  Did everyone appreciate your efforts?</strong></p>
<h5 id="10-blessed-are-those-who-have-been-persecuted-for-the-sake-of-righteousness-for-theirs-is-the-kingdom-of-heaven-11-blessed-are-you-when-people-insult-you-and-persecute-you-and-falsely-say-all-kinds-of-evil-against-you-because-of-me-12-rejoice-and-be-glad-for-your-reward-in-heaven-is-great-for-in-the-same-way-they-persecuted-the-prophets-who-were-before-you">10 “Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 “Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</h5>
<p>Don’t lose heart, or be afraid, when you are persecuted for righteousness.  <strong>God will reward you greatly for such a brave and self sacrificial promotion of His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  Count it all joy!</p>

<p><strong>Do you remember a time when you, or someone you know, was persecuted for righteousness?</strong></p>

<h3 id="show-the-goodness-of-gods-kingdom-to-all-people">Show the Goodness of God’s Kingdom to All People</h3>
<h5 id="13-you-are-the-salt-of-the-earth-but-if-the-salt-has-become-tasteless-how-can-it-be-made-salty-again-it-is-no-longer-good-for-anything-except-to-be-thrown-out-and-trampled-under-foot-by-men">13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.</h5>
<p>At the time Jesus was teaching, salt was scarce and very precious.  <strong>It was sometimes called white gold.</strong>  Roman soldiers were sometimes paid in salt.  Salt was needed to preserve food, especially meat, and <strong>it improved the flavor of whatever food it was added to.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our lives are supposed to show the beauty of holiness and righteousness.</strong>  <strong>Life in new testament times was often hard and cruel.</strong>  Love was often considered a weakness instead of a virtue.  Many people thought that might made right.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus’ teaching described a different world to people, a world in which everyone loved everyone else and even the weak were valued and cared for.  He described a world in which God provides for those who seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Many of Jesus’ hearers fell in love with the world Jesus described, and with Jesus.  They loved the world Jesus described enough to suffer persecution to see it come to pass.</strong>  They loved it enough to commit their lives to God. These were Christians.</p>

<p><strong>When other people saw Christians living the way Jesus taught, some of them became hungry for the world the Christians were living in.</strong>  Some of them became Christians themselves.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <strong>because of temptations from the world, the flesh, and the devil, some Christians cease living as Jesus taught.</strong>  When this happens, <strong>they no longer attract people to Jesus and the kingdom of God.</strong>  In Mat 5:13 Jesus said, “<strong>You are the salt of the earth;</strong> but <strong>if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again?</strong>”.  The metaphor is clear.  Christians who have fallen away from living Jesus’ teachings are no longer salty. They do not attract people to Christ and the kingdom of God.</p>

<h5 id="14-you-are-the-light-of-the-world-a-city-set-on-a-hill-cannot-be-hidden-15-nor-does-anyone-light-a-lamp-and-put-it-under-a-basket-but-on-the-lampstand-and-it-gives-light-to-all-who-are-in-the-house-16-let-your-light-shine-before-men-in-such-a-way-that-they-may-see-your-good-works-and-glorify-your-father-who-is-in-heaven">14 “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; 15 nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. 16 Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</h5>
<p><strong>Because of persecution, even the low level persecution of social snubbing or losing friends, Christians are often tempted to conceal their Christianity when they are around non-Christians.</strong>  Jesus is telling us not to do this, because it eliminates the witness we could be to people by being our true selves and not hiding our beliefs.</p>
<h5 id="17-do-not-think-that-i-came-to-abolish-the-law-or-the-prophets-i-did-not-come-to-abolish-but-to-fulfill-18-for-truly-i-say-to-you-until-heaven-and-earth-pass-away-not-the-smallest-letter-or-stroke-shall-pass-from-the-law-until-all-is-accomplished-19-whoever-then-annuls-one-of-the-least-of-these-commandments-and-teaches-others-to-do-the-same-shall-be-called-least-in-the-kingdom-of-heaven-but-whoever-keeps-and-teaches-them-he-shall-be-called-great-in-the-kingdom-of-heaven">17 “Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. 18 For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished. 19 Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</h5>
<h5 id="20-for-i-say-to-you-that-unless-your-righteousness-surpasses-that-of-the-scribes-and-pharisees-you-will-not-enter-the-kingdom-of-heaven">20 “For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.</h5>

<p><strong>Jesus taught that we are saved by believing in Him instead of by keeping the law.  This naturally led some people to believe that the law is no longer important.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As well taught Christians, we know that this is not true, but it’s an easy mistake for casual listeners to Jesus’ teachings to make.  Jesus taught a different method of salvation than the one in the old covenant, but in the new covenant we are still required to seek righteousness with all of our hearts.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the righteousness required in the new testament is much more complete than old covenant righteousness.  <strong>New covenant righteousness is a righteousness of the heart, not just an outward righteousness.  The Pharisees had outward righteousness, but not heart righteousness!</strong>  Righteousness of the heart of course produces outward righteousness as well.</p>

<p><strong>Believing in Jesus means a lot more than just believing He exists.  It means trusting Him and believing the things He said.</strong>  If I ask a child whether he believes in his dad, I am not asking if he believes his dad exists!  <strong>Believing in a plumber means trusting him to work on your pipes.  Believing in Jesus means doing what He says!</strong></p>

<p>Believing in Jesus also means believing He has your best interests at heart, just as believing in one’s dad means believing he has your best interests at heart.</p>

<h5 id="21-you-have-heard-that-the-ancients-were-told-you-shall-not-commit-murder-and-whoever-commits-murder-shall-be-liable-to-the-court-22-but-i-say-to-you-that-everyone-who-is-angry-with-his-brother-shall-be-guilty-before-the-court-and-whoever-says-to-his-brother-you-good-for-nothing-shall-be-guilty-before-the-supreme-court-and-whoever-says-you-fool-shall-be-guilty-enough-to-go-into-the-fiery-hell">21 “You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘You shall not commit murder’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’ 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before  the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the  fiery hell.</h5>
<p>The old covenant failed because of people’s repeated sins.  <strong>People sinned because their hearts were not good.  Sin always begins in the heart.  Often, it begins with anger or lust.</strong></p>

<p>Because people are so good at deceiving themselves, <strong>most people can deceive themselves into believing that what they want to do is actually right. The only cure for this is for people to want to do the right things.</strong>  God knows this, so <strong>in the new covenant He wants us to focus on making our hearts right!</strong></p>

<p>If I allow myself to be angry at people, more visible bad things will follow.  At the very least, I will no longer have a loving relationship with them.  Fights of one sort or another will likely develop.  In verses 21 &amp; 22 above, Jesus said that anger at someone is like murdering them in my heart, and said that anger is a serious sin!</p>

<p>A good heart produces good actions, but sometimes people with bad hearts will do good deeds with wrong motives.  A bad man may do good deeds so that other people will think he is good.  He might avoid bad actions to avoid punishment.  Good deeds do not impress God if the heart motive is bad.  The Apostle Paul addresses the importance of the heart in 1 Cor 13: 3.
<strong>1 Cor 13:3 - And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.</strong></p>

<h5 id="mat-523---therefore-if-you-are-presenting-your-offering-at-the-altar-and-there-remember-that-your-brother-has-something-against-you-24-leave-your-offering-there-before-the-altar-and-go-first-be-reconciled-to-your-brother-and-then-come-and-present-your-offering-25-make-friends-quickly-with-your-opponent-at-law-while-you-are-with-him-on-the-way-so-that-your-opponent-may-not-hand-you-over-to-the-judge-and-the-judge-to-the-officer-and-you-be-thrown-into-prison-26-truly-i-say-to-you-you-will-not-come-out-of-there-until-you-have-paid-up-the-last-cent">Mat 5:23 - <em>Therefore</em> if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering. 25 Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent.</h5>
<p><strong>The word “Therefore” in verse 23 means that what follows is because anger is a sin.  Since anger is a sin, I should not do anything to make my brother angry at me.</strong>  I don’t want him to sin.  If I know my brother has something against me, I should go make it right with him immediately.  Similarly, I should settle law suits where possible, especially when I am at fault.</p>
<h5 id="27-you-have-heard-that-it-was-said-you-shall-not-commit-adultery-28-but-i-say-to-you-that-everyone-who-looks-at-a-woman-with-lust-for-her-has-already-committed-adultery-with-her-in-his-heart-29-if-your-right-eye-makes-you-stumble-tear-it-out-and-throw-it-from-you-for-it-is-better-for-you-to-lose-one-of-the-parts-of-your-body-than-for-your-whole-body-to-be-thrown-into-hell-30-if-your-right-hand-makes-you-stumble-cut-it-off-and-throw-it-from-you-for-it-is-better-for-you-to-lose-one-of-the-parts-of-your-body-than-for-your-whole-body-to-go-into-hell">27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery’; 28 but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into  hell. 30 If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into  hell.</h5>
<p>If a married man lusts after another woman, he is committing adultery with her in his heart.  <strong>This is not really debatable.  If you doubt it, ask your wife!</strong>  She will tell you clearly that you are committing adultery against her in your heart.  She will feel sinned against and angry.</p>

<p><strong>Also, all physical adultery begins with lusting after another woman.</strong>  Lusting after women is a hard wired reflex in most men, so it’s not completely consciously controllable, <strong>but a boundary is crossed when a man looks at a woman for the purpose of lusting after her.</strong>  Looking at her is a controllable physical act.  Also, a man can choose not to pay attention to lust even when he is looking at an attractive woman.  He can put his attention on other things.</p>

<p>Jesus followed the warning about lust with a warning that adultery can lead to being cast into hell.  This is somewhat complicated.  <strong>First, he is speaking to people who only know the old covenant.</strong>  Second, <strong>the word translated hell in this passage is Gehenna.  Gehenna was the name of a valley West &amp; South of Jerusalem where dead animals and garbage were burned.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We will discuss the nature of hell later.</strong>  It’s a complicated issue because Jesus never used the word hell.  Jesus used three different words in the gospels which seem to have contradictory meanings! All three of these words are translated as hell in most bibles.  We will discuss this in detail later.</p>
<h5 id="31-it-was-said-whoever-sends-his-wife-away-let-him-give-her-a-certificate-of-divorce-32-but-i-say-to-you-that-everyone-who-divorces-his-wife-except-for-the-reason-of-unchastity-makes-her-commit-adultery-and-whoever-marries-a-divorced-woman-commits-adultery">31 “It was said, ‘Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorce’; 32 but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</h5>
<p><strong>In the old testament, men were allowed to divorce their wives.</strong> (Deuteronomy 24:1)   Rabbis apparently disagreed as regards how difficult it should be for a man to get a divorce.  <strong>Jesus changed this and forbid men to divorce.</strong></p>

<p><strong>He explained more fully in Mat 19:3-9.</strong>  He explained that in the old testament men were allowed to divorce their wives because of the hardness of their hearts.   One can speculate that this was because if a man was not allowed to divorce a wife he no longer wanted, he might treat her very badly.</p>

<p>The apostle Paul described some situations in which it might be legitimate for a man or wife to leave their spouse in 1 Cor 7:10-16 .</p>

<p><strong>We are living in the new covenant instead of the old covenant.  Jesus’ teachings are life principles instead of rigid laws.</strong>  Spousal abuse or other circumstances might sometimes make divorce necessary.  When this happens, we have flexibility.  <strong>We can ask God to guide us by His Holy Spirit, and we can apply our own reason.</strong>  Living as the sons and daughters of God is much better than living under a large set of rigid laws.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>an unjustified divorce can be forgiven if we confess our part in it as sin and genuinely repent.</strong>  This is just like any other sin.  <strong>Nevertheless, God hates divorce and we should do all we can to avoid it.</strong></p>
<h5 id="sex-outside-of-marriage-and-homosexuality">Sex Outside of Marriage and Homosexuality</h5>
<p>Jesus did not teach about sex outside of marriage or homosexuality because <strong>these were very serious sins in the old testament, and his audience already new that they are sins.</strong>  He did not need to take time teaching about them.  If these were no longer sins, he would have told them about it.</p>
<h5 id="33-again-you-have-heard-that-the-ancients-were-told-you-shall-not-make-false-vows-but-shall-fulfill-your-vows-to-the-lord-34-but-i-say-to-you-make-no-oath-at-all-either-by-heaven-for-it-is-the-throne-of-god-35-or-by-the-earth-for-it-is-the-footstool-of-his-feet-or-by-jerusalem-for-it-is-the-city-of-the-great-king-36-nor-shall-you-make-an-oath-by-your-head-for-you-cannot-make-one-hair-white-or-black-37-but-let-your-statement-be-yes-yes-or-no-no-anything-beyond-these-is-of-evil">33 “Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, ‘ You shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.’ 34 But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your statement be, ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no’; anything beyond these is of evil.</h5>
<p>Vows are not a big deal in the modern world, so we won’t spend time on verses 33-37.</p>

<h5 id="38-you-have-heard-that-it-was-said-an-eye-for-an-eye-and-a-tooth-for-a-tooth-39-but-i-say-to-you-do-not-resist-an-evil-person-but-whoever-slaps-you-on-your-right-cheek-turn-the-other-to-him-also-40-if-anyone-wants-to-sue-you-and-take-your-shirt-let-him-have-your-coat-also-41-whoever-forces-you-to-go-one-mile-go-with-him-two-42-give-to-him-who-asks-of-you-and-do-not-turn-away-from-him-who-wants-to-borrow-from-you">38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ 39 But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. 40 If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also. 41 Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. 42 Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.</h5>
<p><strong>This is really radical!</strong>  Why did Jesus teach this?  Why does Jesus want us to behave this way?  To understand this, start by asking yourself what you think Jesus would do in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think Jesus would have done in each of these circumstances?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How did Jesus react when people crucified Him on a cross?</li>
  <li>Suppose someone slapped Jesus on His right cheek?</li>
  <li>Suppose someone sued Jesus to take His shirt.</li>
  <li>Suppose someone forced Jesus to go one mile. (A soldier could order anyone to carry his pack for up to a mile. )</li>
  <li>Suppose someone wanted to borrow from Jesus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In each case, why do you think Jesus acted this way?</strong></p>

<p>Jesus said that <strong>the entire law and prophets is summed up in loving God and loving people.</strong>  He also taught that <strong>we must forgive</strong> whoever does us harm.</p>

<p><strong>Were Jesus’ actions in each case loving?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Would Jesus have suffered serious permanent harm in any of these cases?  Explain?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Would Jesus’ actions have had a strong evangelistic impact on those doing Him harm.  Would they have made His witness to them more impactful?</strong>  Imagine the conversations He might have had with them.</p>

<p><strong>Mat 6:33 says that if we seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, then God will provide all of our physical needs.</strong>  He says a few versus later, in Mat 7:7-11, that if we seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, then He will give us any genuinely good thing we ask for in prayer.  This means that whatever anyone does to us, we will come out in good shape if we are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. <strong>We don’t need to fear the consequences of doing what Jesus tells us to do.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If we give it a little thought, it is not hard to see why Jesus teaches us to respond this way to provocations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are biologically wired to respond with anger and hatred when someone hurts us.</strong>  Anger and hatred are the opposite of love.   They are the opposite of God’s kingdom.  <strong>If Satan can move us into anger and hatred by convincing someone he has some control of to hurt us, then he can always defeat the coming of God’s kingdom!</strong></p>

<p>If we become angry at the person who hurt us, then we may hurt or attack them.  This will make them angry at us, and a feud will have started.  <strong>This is the complete opposite of God’s kingdom and Satan wins easily!</strong></p>

<p>If instead of getting angry I show them love, I defeat Satan’s strategy!  In fact, I open the door to a powerful witness to them.</p>

<p>David Wilkerson was an Assembly of God preacher.  In the 1950’s he felt led by God to leave his church and begin witnessing to the children in the street gangs of New York city.  This was a difficult ministry.</p>

<p><strong>One day early in his ministry, he was standing in front of several street gangs preaching to them, and one of the gang leaders threatened to cut him up into small pieces if he didn’t leave.</strong>  Wilkerson responded by telling him, <strong>“If you cut me into a thousand little cubes, each piece will cry out, ‘I love you!’ “</strong>  He continued preaching, and led the leaders of two of the gangs to salvation that day!  This story is found in <em>The Cross and the Switchblade</em>, his autobiography.</p>

<p><strong>We are living in the new covenant instead of the old covenant.  Jesus’ teachings are life principles instead of rigid laws.</strong>  <strong>Occasionally, one of His teachings may come into conflict with something else He wants us to do.</strong>  When this happens, we have flexibility.  <strong>We can ask God to lead us by His Holy Spirit, and we can apply our own reason.</strong>  Living as the sons and daughters of God is much better than living under a large set of rigid laws.</p>

<p>In Mat 38-42, Jesus told us to repay those who hurt us with kindness and love.  This is an example of loving our enemies.  When we looked at Mat 38-42, we saw that responding to hate with love defeats Satan’s attempts to fill the world with hate instead of love.  God’s kingdom is a kingdom of love.  Responding to hate with more hate would prevent God’s kingdom from coming.</p>

<p>Furthermore, responding to hate with hate would start a vicious cycle of more and more hate.  <strong>Remember the famous feud between the Hatfields and McCoys.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When a husband and wife are fighting, they are to some degree seeing each other as enemies.</strong>  If the argument is intense, they become filled with anger or even hate.  If each decides to love their enemies, that puts an end to the fight.</p>

<p><strong>Most of the hate in the world is people hating others whom they think of as their enemies.  The only way to reduce the amount of hate in the world is to start loving our enemies.</strong></p>

<p>Verses 46-47 say that even sinners love those who love them.  If I only love those who love me, I am no better than a sinner.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus said that we must love our enemies!  This sounds really radical, but it’s absolutely essential for a Christian life!</strong>  We cannot ignore this teaching if we want a good relationship with God.  <strong>It’s not optional.</strong>  Loving one’s enemies is the hallmark of a true Christian.</p>

<p><strong>Most of the anger and hatred in the world would stop if people started loving their enemies, and it will not stop any other way!</strong>  This includes anger between spouses and anger between parents and children.</p>

<p><strong>In the Lord’s prayer, Jesus is teaching us how to pray.  Rabbis in Jesus’ day often taught using outlines.</strong>  This appears to be an outline of how to pray.  There are several very important principles in verses 7-9.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>He tells us not to use meaningless repetition.  <strong>He says we will not be heard for our many words.  Prayer is not an incantation or magic spell.</strong>  God is not a machine!  He calls God our Father.  God is a person.  He is a more intelligent, wise, and loving person than we are!  Prayer is simply talking to Him.  How would you feel if your child kept repeating the same request to you over and over again?  God feels the same way.</p>

    <p>Jesus said that God knows what we need before we ask Him.  <strong>We must treat God as a very  intelligent, wise, and loving person who is not hard of hearing or ignorant of our needs.</strong></p>

    <p>There is one kind of repetition in prayer which is valuable.  <strong>If the prayer is one which takes a  long time for the answer to come, such as praying for someone’s salvation, it is good to keep praying for the same thing every day, or perhaps every week.</strong>  This shows God how important the request is to us, and it reminds us that God is at work.  If we quit praying, we may just give up on God and decide the situation is hopeless.  This is very different from just repeating the same request over and over in one sitting.</p>

    <p><strong>The overall principle is simple.</strong>  God is your Father and you are His child.  <strong>When you ask God for something, behave as a sensible child asking his father for something.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jesus referred to God as our father.</strong>  This is tremendously good news!  Take it to heart!  Meditate on all it implies!  Prayer is so simple.  It’s merely talking to our father.  Furthermore, our father is extremely intelligent, knowledgeable, wise, and loving.  He cares for you.  Act like all of this is true when you pray.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>God knows what we need before we pray.</strong>  God knows all the circumstances of our lives, and <strong>He knows what is best for us.</strong>  He knows our <strong>true</strong> needs.  <strong>Sometimes He will not give us something because He knows it is not best to do so.  This is like happens with any child asking His father for something.</strong> Think about any child being carried through a grocery store or toy store, for instance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="9-pray-then-in-this-way--our-father-who-is-in-heaven--hallowed-be-your-name">9 Pray, then, in this way:  Our Father who is in heaven,  Hallowed be Your name.</h5>

<p>Jesus told us to address God as father when we pray!  <strong>Do you address God as father when you pray?</strong>  Calling God father <strong>reminds</strong> us that <strong>He cares about us and promises to provide for us and defend us.</strong>  It also reminds us that <strong>He is much more intelligent than us, much more knowledgeable than us, and much wiser than us.</strong>  <strong>This means he will not always think about things the same way we do</strong>, and <strong>will sometimes refuse requests that seem reasonable to us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus told us to pray “Hallowed be your name.”</strong>  This can be interpreted two ways.  <strong>It could mean that we are to pray that God’s name will be hallowed throughout the earth.</strong>  This is a prayer for revival! Any place where God’s name is hallowed has experienced revival.  <strong>Praying “hallowed be thy name” is one way to pray for revival.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Alternatively, it could mean “Your name is worthy of being hallowed” or “I hallow your name”.</strong>  In either of these cases it means “I praise you.”  <strong>If this interpretation is correct, then Jesus was saying that we should start our prayer by praising God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In my own prayer times, I have found that I pray much better if I start by spending some time praising God</strong> and thanking Him for the things He has done for me.  <strong>Praising God and thanking Him increases my faith a lot.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Increasing my faith causes me to love God more and to be much more righteous in my thoughts.</strong>  It also frees me from anxieties and worldly concerns, because I trust God to take care of me.  <strong>This increases the quality of my remaining prayers a lot.</strong>  <strong>I almost always start my prayer times by praising and thanking God.</strong>  It’s time very well spent.</p>
<h5 id="10-your-kingdom-come--your-will-be-done--on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven">10 ‘Your kingdom come.  Your will be done,  On earth as it is in heaven.</h5>
<p>In John 12:31 Jesus said, “Now judgment is upon this world; now <strong>the ruler of this world will be cast out</strong>”.  In 2 Cor 4:3-4 Paul said, “And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4 in whose case <strong>the god of this world</strong> has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.”  In 1 John 5:19, the Apostle John said, “We know that we are of God, and that <strong>the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.</strong>”</p>

<p>Jesus and God the Father are the real gods of this world, but <strong>Satan rules the world through people</strong> because he has convinced most people to do the things he wants.  <strong>God allows Satan to speak to people in their minds and hearts.  Satan deceives people and tempts them to do wrong.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Satan is clever, and he appeals to our pride, our passions, and our selfishness.  He often tempts us through other people instead of directly.</strong>  Many of the shows we see on television or at the movies promote attitudes, beliefs, and desires that lead us away from God’s kingdom.  <strong>This is because many of the people who finance, write, and produce shows are living in Satan’s kingdom instead of God’s.  By tempting and deceiving a small but powerful group of influencers, Satan can tempt and deceive a very large group of people indirectly.</strong>  Most temptation comes to us from the culture, our parents, or our friends instead of directly from Satan.</p>

<p><strong>Society is full of hierarchy’s of influence.</strong>  These exist in television, movies, books, blogs and websites, social media, education, industry, government, etc.  <strong>Parents have strong influence over their children, so Satan can build his kingdom in people while they are still very young by first building it in their parents.</strong>  He can also work through their schools and friends.</p>

<p>Because of this huge collection of sinful influences, almost the whole world is in Satan’s kingdom instead of Gods.  <strong>In Mat 6:10 Jesus told us to pray, “Your kingdom come.  Your will be done,  On earth as it is in heaven.”</strong>  Jesus would not have instructed us to pray this way if it would not make a difference.  <strong>When we ask for God’s kingdom to come in a situation, He begins using His resources to change the way people think or act, or to replace some of the people, or perhaps to change external circumstances.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If a husband and wife are fighting, the angry fighting is from Satan’s influence instead of God’s.  Asking for God’s kingdom to come is asking for the anger to be replaced by love.</strong>  If a man is neglecting his family because he is a workaholic, this is a result of Satan’s influences instead of God’s.  Asking for God’s kingdom to come in his heart and mind is asking for him to see the light.  If a man is caught up in drugs and alcohol, this is a manifestation of Satan’s kingdom.  If war is brewing between two countries, this is usually Satan’s work.</p>

<p><strong>Notice that most intercession is not trying to convince God to do something He does not want to do.  Most intercession is inviting God to do what He already wants to do.</strong>  Unless we ask God to intervene, He usually lets nature take it’s course.  <strong>He gives people free will,</strong> and allows the consequences of their actions to develop naturally.  Intercession is inviting God to come into a situation instead of keeping His hands off of it.  It’s inviting His presence.</p>

<p><strong>If people on earth invite God’s presence and rule, He will come and rule.  If not, He will allow people to do what they want and whatever happens happens.</strong>  Meanwhile <strong>Satan will be tempting and deceiving people</strong> to get them to think and do things that produce really evil and horrible outcomes.  <strong>He will be trying to separate people forever from God.</strong>  He tries to keep people from being saved, and tries to get them killed before they can change their minds.</p>
<h5 id="11-give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread">11 ‘Give us this day our daily bread.</h5>
<p>God promises to supply our daily needs, but He requires us to ask Him.  Jesus promised in Mat 6:33 that <strong>if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, then He will supply all of our material needs.</strong></p>
<h5 id="12-and-forgive-us-our-debts-as-we-also-have-forgiven-our-debtors">12 ‘And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</h5>
<p>Jesus said that we should ask God to forgive our sins.  1 John 1:9 says, “<strong>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</strong>”  Notice that <strong>confessing our sins to God is a prerequisite of forgiveness.</strong>  The confession needs to be <strong>specific,</strong> not just a general confession that you are a sinner.</p>

<p>Verse 12 also says that we must forgive those who have sinned against us.  Verses 14 &amp; 15, which follow the Lord’s prayer, spell this out in detail.  Jesus said, <strong>“For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.”</strong>  This is a serious restriction!</p>

<p>Most people do not take Jesus’ statement that we must forgive people who sin against us seriously enough.  They think of unforgiveness as a small sin, almost minor.  <strong>IT IS NOT!!!</strong>  More people probably fail in there attempt to have a close relationship with God for this reason than any other.  <strong>Harboring any unforgiveness in your heart toward anyone will cripple your relationship with God, because your sins will not be forgiven!.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus taught the following in Mat 18:21-35.</p>

<p><strong>Mat 18:21-35</strong></p>
<h5 id="21-then-peter-came-and-said-to-him-lord-how-often-shall-my-brother-sin-against-me-and-i-forgive-him-up-to-seven-times-22-jesus-said-to-him-i-do-not-say-to-you-up-to-seven-times-but-up-to-seventy-times-seven">21 Then Peter came and said to Him, <strong>“Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?” 22 Jesus *said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Holding unforgiveness in one’s heart is a major sin with major consequences. It will cripple your relationship with God.</strong></p>
<h5 id="13-and-do-not-lead-us-into-temptation-but-deliver-us-from-evil">13 ‘And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from  evil.</h5>
<p>The NIV translation of the bible translates verse 13 as <strong>“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.”</strong>  This translation makes excellent sense.  <strong>Satan tries to defeat us by tempting us and deceiving us.  Jesus is telling us to ask God to not allow Satan to tempt us too much.</strong>  This will increase our chance of living a righteous and successful life.  It will increase our chance of having a strong relationship with God.  <strong>Do not be too proud to ask God to not allow you to be tested too hard!</strong></p>

God only owns a tiny corner of their hearts.</strong>  If they had spent most of their effort seeking the kingdom of God and His righteousness, they would love God’s kingdom with all their hearts.</p>

If your attention is usually focused on things that are bad, how great is the darkness in you.  <strong>We should focus our attention on heavenly things instead of on money.</strong>  <strong>The kind of treasure we acquire is determined by what we focus our attention on.</strong>  The things we ultimately love are determined by <strong>what we focus our attention on.</strong></p>

<p>Notice the word <strong>“serve”</strong> in this verse.  Suppose your boss at work asks you to dump toxic waste in the river.  If you are serving wealth, you will go ahead and do it.  If you are serving God, you will risk your job by refusing to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Suppose you are at lunch with several colleagues from work, and they invite you to go to happy hour with them after work for drinking.</strong>  Suppose you are a salesman and need to lie to your customers about your product, or deceive them in some way, to make enough sales.  <strong>Suppose you put so much time and effort into your work that you don’t have time to seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Life will force you to make a decision about what you are really going to serve.</strong> God is watching you always, and He cannot be fooled.  He even knows your thoughts.  <strong>He will know which decision you have made.</strong>  If you have decided you want things of the world more than you want God and righteousness, you have committed yourself to a life that will separate you from God.  <strong>You can have money, but you cannot serve it.</strong></p>

Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, 29 yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.</h5>

<h5 id="33-but-seek-first-his-kingdom-and-his-righteousness-and-all-these-things-will-be-added-to-you"><strong>33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>This is one of the most amazing promises in the bible.</strong>  It is also one of the most revealing of the relationship God wants with us.  <strong>Jesus said that if we seek first God’s kingdom and His righteousness, God will provide all of our material needs!</strong>  This is amazing!</p>

<p>Being a Christian is a very intense and intimate relationship with God!  <strong>It’s intense because we are seeking God’s kingdom and His righteousness more than we are seeking our own material welfare.  We are depending on God for our welfare.</strong>  It’s intimate because God is so involved in the details of our personal lives.  <strong>It’s also intimate because we love God this much and He loves us back!</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of important things to note.  <strong>First, Jesus did not mean that we should quit our jobs.</strong>  The Apostle Paul made tents to provide for his own welfare. (Acts 18:2-3)  <strong>When a Christian needs money, the most common way God provides it is by helping him find a suitable job.</strong>  Most Christians spend part of their time earning money, but they do not <strong>serve</strong> their jobs.  <strong>When decisions have to be made between serving God and money, they serve God.</strong> They trust God for their material needs. <strong>They love God more than anything else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Second, God’s promise that He will provide all of our material needs if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness is the cure for poverty.</strong>  If someone in poverty will truly give his heart to God, then God will supply his material needs.  <strong>At first God may supply them through the church, but in most cases He will eventually provide the new believer with provision that does not depend on charity.</strong>  He may provide non charity support immediately.</p>
<h5 id="34-so-do-not-worry-about-tomorrow-for-tomorrow-will-care-for-itself-each-day-has-enough-trouble-of-its-own">34 “So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</h5>
<p><strong>Even if I have enough money for my present needs, I may worry that I won’t have enough in the future.</strong>  This will tempt me to seek money more than I seek God.  In verse 34, Jesus warns us to not succumb to this temptation.</p>

<p>Jesus said in the Lord’s prayer that God will not forgive our sins if we don’t forgive people who sin against us.  Mat 7:1-2 is similar.  <strong>Jesus said that however I judge other people, I will be judged by the same standard.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In verses 3-5, Jesus said that we don’t even see most of our own sins!</strong>  This means that we are much more in danger of being judged than we realize.  <strong>Jesus said that I probably have much worse sins in my own life than the sin I am judging in yours!  He says I don’t even see the bad sins in my own life!</strong></p>

<p><strong>This would be very surprising and hard to believe if we had not already studied the deceitfulness of sin, the ways we avoid seeing our own sins.</strong>  Remember the story of John Newton, who wrote the hymn <em>Amazing Grace.</em>  Most people have difficulty understanding this passage because they are not aware of the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<h5 id="6-do-not-give-what-is-holy-to-dogs-and-do-not-throw-your-pearls-before-swine-or-they-will-trample-them-under-their-feet-and-turn-and-tear-you-to-pieces">6 Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</h5>
<p><strong>New Christians, who are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, want other people to know that they need to be righteous too.  It’s only natural.</strong>  In verses 1-5, Jesus warned us not to judge other Christian’s sins so that our own undiscerned sins will not be judged.</p>

<p><strong>In verse 6, He warns us that some non Christians will persecute us for preaching to them.</strong>  We must be a city on a hill and show our light to the world, but we must also have the wisdom to not persist in preaching to people who will only persecute us for it!  We should ask the Lord for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="prayer-promises">Prayer Promises</h3>

<p><strong>This amazing prayer promise is still in the context of “<em>Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</em>”  The promise only belongs to those who are seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p>God only promises to give <strong>what is good</strong> to those who ask. (verse 11)  When a parent walks through a toy store with his children, they are likely to ask for many things the parent judges it would not be good to give them at this time.</p>

<p><strong>God is vastly more intelligent and knowledgeable than we are.  We are like small children to Him.  When we ask Him for something, He looks at our hearts and sees the core need we are trying to get met.  He gives us what will actually work best in our lives.</strong>  This may or may not be what we asked for.  <strong>He may also see that the answer will have to be delayed for one reason or another.</strong>  If we are praying with a bad motive, God may simply say no.  <strong>In this case, we are not seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When we pray, unless we are praying with wrong motives, God will always give us either what we asked for or something better than what we asked for.</strong>
This promise is only for those who are seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</p>
<h5 id="12-in-everything-therefore-treat-people-the-same-way-you-want-them-to-treat-you-for-this-is-the-law-and-the-prophets">12 “In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</h5>

<p>Treat people well, without fear, because God is providing for you.  <strong>You don’t <em>need</em> to be selfish.  You don’t need to try to fool them or take things from them.  Most of the motives for not showing people love are removed, because our own needs are so well taken care of.</strong>  God is answering all of our prayers, except when we ask for something we shouldn’t have.</p>

<h3 id="the-requirements-for-salvation">The Requirements for Salvation</h3>

<h5 id="13-enter-through-the-narrow-gate-for-the-gate-is-wide-and-the-way-is-broad-that-leads-to-destruction-and-there-are-many-who-enter-through-it-14-for-the-gate-is-small-and-the-way-is-narrow-that-leads-to-life-and-there-are-few-who-find-it">13 “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. 14 For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.</h5>
<p><strong>These are the most frightening two verses in the bible.  It’s obvious that only a few people will be saved!  Jesus explains the reason in the following verses.</strong></p>

<h5 id="15-beware-of-the-false-prophets-who-come-to-you-in-sheeps-clothing-but-inwardly-are-ravenous-wolves-16-you-will-know-them-by-their-fruits-grapes-are-not-gathered-from-thorn-bushes-nor-figs-from-thistles-are-they-17-so-every-good-tree-bears-good-fruit-but-the-bad-tree-bears-bad-fruit-18-a-good-tree-cannot-produce-bad-fruit-nor-can-a-bad-tree-produce-good-fruit-19-every-tree-that-does-not-bear-good-fruit-is-cut-down-and-thrown-into-the-fire-20-so-then-you-will-know-them-by-their-fruits">15 “Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 <strong>You will  know them by their fruits.</strong> Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? 17 So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. 19 <strong>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So then, you will know them by their fruits.</strong></h5>
<p>A good tree is a metaphor for a good man or woman.  Fruit is a metaphor for one’s behavior.  A man with good fruit is a man who does the things Jesus taught in the sermon on the mount.  A man with bad fruit is one who does not do the things Jesus said we must do.</p>

<p><strong>We are saved by faith in Jesus, not by works, but faith is invisible.  We are saved by having good hearts that love Jesus and love righteousness, but one cannot see someone’s heart.  In this passage Jesus says that we can tell someone’s heart by looking at his actions.  Our good or bad actions make our hearts visible.</strong></p>

<p>People with bad actions do not have a good relationship with God.  They are not seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.  If this continues for the rest of their lives, they will be lost.  God wants everyone to be saved, but He will not give eternal life to someone who has a bad heart.  This would make them a problem to everyone else for all of eternity.</p>
<h5 id="21-not-everyone-who-says-to-me-lord-lord-will-enter-the-kingdom-of-heaven-but-he-who-does-the-will-of-my-father-who-is-in-heaven-will-enter-22-many-will-say-to-me-on-that-day-lord-lord-did-we-not-prophesy-in-your-name-and-in-your-name-cast-out-demons-and-in-your-name-perform-many-miracles-23-and-then-i-will-declare-to-them-i-never-knew-you-depart-from-me-you-who-practice-lawlessness">21 <strong>Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.</strong> 22 Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ 23 <strong>And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.’</strong></h5>

<h5 id="24-therefore-everyone-who-hears-these-words-of-mine-and-acts-on-them-may-be-compared-to-a-wise-man-who-built-his-house-on-the-rock-25-and-the-rain-fell-and-the-floods-came-and-the-winds-blew-and-slammed-against-that-house-and-yet-it-did-not-fall-for-it-had-been-founded-on-the-rock-26-everyone-who-hears-these-words-of-mine-and-does-not-act-on-them-will-be-like-a-foolish-man-who-built-his-house-on-the-sand-27-the-rain-fell-and-the-floods-came-and-the-winds-blew-and-slammed-against-that-house-and-it-felland-great-was-its-fall">24 “Therefore everyone who hears <strong>these words of Mine</strong> and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. 26 Everyone who hears <strong>these words of Mine</strong> and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.”</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus said in this passage that everyone who hears “These words of Mine” and acts on them will be saved.  He said that everyone who hears “These words of Mine” and does not act on them will be lost.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“These words of Mine” clearly refers to the words Jesus just spoke in the sermon on the mount.</strong>  People who do the things Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount will be saved.  <strong>People who do not do the things Jesus taught in the sermon on the mount will not be saved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most people consider the morality taught in the sermon on the mount to be so radical that it is impractical.  They don’t even try to do most of it.  This explains why Jesus said in verse 14 that only a few people go through the small gate and narrow way that leads to life.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is concerned with our hearts, and our actions are merely an indicator of our hearts.  <strong>The measure of success is not perfection in our actions.  The measure of success is a heart that loves Jesus and righteousness, and is trying hard.</strong>  Because of our flesh, we will sometimes slip, but we will confess our sins to God and resume our walk of faith.  Notice that Jesus said in verse 23, <strong>“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.”</strong> The people He sent away are people whom He never knew.  <strong>They practice lawlessness instead of occasionally slipping.</strong></p>
<h5 id="28-when-jesus-had-finished-these-words-the-crowds-were-amazed-at-his-teaching-29-for-he-was-teaching-them-as-one-having-authority-and-not-as-their-scribes">28   When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at His teaching; 29 for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.</h5>

<h3 id="life-application-of-commandments-and-promises">Life Application of Commandments and Promises</h3>

<p><strong>Make a list of all the moral commandments Jesus gave in the sermon on the mount.  Be specific instead of general.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For each commandment in the list, make up at least two stories that show what keeping or breaking the commandment looks like in real life.</strong>  This will help us learn how to interpret the commandment, and will help us remember and keep it.</p>

<p><strong>Now make a list of all the promises Jesus made in the sermon on the mount.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For each promise, list the requirements for receiving the promise and any limitations on the promise.</strong>  Some of the requirements may be implicit.  <strong>for each promise, make up at least two stories that show how the promise could be used to good effect in real life.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Go through the list of commandments and ask yourself the following questions for each.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Do I understand why Jesus wants me to keep this commandment</li>
  <li>Do I believe in my heart that I really need to keep this commandment?</li>
  <li>Am I currently keeping this commandment?  If not, what would it take for me to keep it.</li>
  <li>What are the likely consequences in my life of not keeping it.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Go through the list of promises and ask yourself the following questions for each.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Do I meet the prerequisites for this promise?  What are the limitations on it?</li>
  <li>Do I currently need to depend on this promise for something in my life?</li>
  <li>In my heart, do I really believe God will do for me what Jesus said He would do?</li>
  <li>If I don’t really believe this promise, what are the consequences in my life of not believing it?</li>
