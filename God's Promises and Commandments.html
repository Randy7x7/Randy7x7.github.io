    <h1>God's Promises and Commandments</h1>
    <main>
      <p><strong>Both the old and new testaments are filled with promises that God will provide abundantly for us if we will seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  The old testament is also filled with commandments that we must keep to be in right relationship with God.</p>

<p>The new testament is filled with moral teachings which Jesus warned us strongly we must keep.  They are not rigid laws with specified penalties, like in the old testament, but Jesus warned us that we must abide by them.  <strong>For simplicity, these moral teachings will be referred to here as commandments also.</strong></p>

<p><strong>God promises to provide all of our material needs and all of our spiritual needs if we will seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  God is not stingy and He is not poor.  He has said that we are His children!  God will provide for our needs abundantly instead of poorly.  He is a good Father.</p>

<p><strong>If a Christian seeks out God’s promises in the bible and spends a great deal of time thinking about them and meditating on them, he will grow to love God and trust Him.  His faith in God will become strong.</strong>  When he loves God and trusts Him a lot, he will try hard to do the things Jesus told him to do.  <strong>Since he loves God, trusts Him, and is trying hard to do the things Jesus said to do, God will fill him with the Holy Spirit and he will be a strong Christian!</strong></p>

<p><strong>If a Christian seeks out Jesus’ commandments in the new testament, meditates on them, and prays about them, wonderful things will happen.</strong>  He will gradually come to understand why they are necessary and how they apply in his life.  Also, God will gradually give him the understanding and power he needs to apply them.  <strong>Because he is really keeping Jesus’ commandments in his heart and life, God will fill him very full of the Holy Spirit.  He will be a strong Christian.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most Christians are weak because they do not diligently seek out God’s promises and commands and apply them to their own lives.</strong>  It is uncomfortable to spend time meditating on God’s commands and talking to God about them, <strong>unless I am willing to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong>  I will of course also need the Holy Spirit’s help to apply them, because of the weakness of my flesh.  <strong>God will give me this help when He sees I am fully seeking Him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most people also don’t spend time seeking out God’s promises and meditating on them.  The reasons for this are complicated.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Most people don’t understand that God’s promises are only available if they are genuinely seeking <em>first</em> God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  Therefore, they are disappointed when God doesn’t seem to keep His promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are not aware of their undiscerned sins.</strong>  Therefore, they are disappointed when God doesn’t seem to keep His promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>They don’t understand that we are like children compared to God, and often want things that would not really be good for us.  God will only give us good things.</strong>  Therefore, they are disappointed when God does not seem to keep His promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many people interpret scripture wrong.  They interpret it as if every statement by God was part of a legal document or like a law of nature.</strong>  The new testament was written in a <strong>conversational</strong> style instead of a <strong>legal</strong> or <strong>scientific</strong> style.</p>

    <p><strong>A law in a legal document must note all of the exceptions and prerequisites of the law.  People do not talk that way in conversation.</strong>  Noting all of the possible exceptions and complications of every statement would <strong>slow conversation down to a crawl.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The new testament is the same way.  Every statement in it is essentially true, but there may be exceptions or complications.</strong>  These may be explored elsewhere in scripture.  <strong>It’s a good general rule that every verse in scripture should be interpreted in light of the rest of scripture.</strong> This simple rule eliminates most apparent impossibilities and inconsistencies in scripture, and it leads to the correct interpretations of God’s promises and commandments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For all of these reason’s people’s faith in God’s promises is small.  <strong>None of this decreases the importance or value of God’s promises for someone who has decided to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong>  For such a person, the promises of God are a <strong>treasure chest!</strong>  They are a source of provision in life, and continuing joy and wonder.  <strong>God’s promises, rightly understood, are true and can be fully relied upon if you are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p>The promises of God are a Christian’s power source, both in the physical and spiritual worlds.  <strong>Seeking out God’s promises and meditating on them frequently will enormously increase your faith and victory in all areas of life.</strong>  Please do not miss this key to joy and victory in the Christian life.</p>

<p><strong>The following are a few examples of God’s promises and commandments.  All of the promises are true, important for living the Christian life, and can be relied upon completely.  Obeying <em>all</em> of the commands is truly essential for a victorious Christian life.</strong>  God will help you if you really try.  Remember to depend upon His promises.</p>

<h5 id="19-do-not-store-up-for-yourselves-treasures-on-earth-where-moth-and-rust-destroy-and-where-thieves-break-in-and-steal-20-but-store-up-for-yourselves-treasures-in-heaven-where-neither-moth-nor-rust-destroys-and-where-thieves-do-not-break-in-or-steal-21-for-where-your-treasure-is-there-your-heart-will-be-also">19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; 21 <em>for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</em></h5>
<p>Jesus said that we must love God with all our hearts, and love our neighbors as ourselves. (Mat 22:36-40)  <strong>God cares about our hearts more than anything else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus said that where I build my treasure will determine where my heart is.</strong>  Most Christians spend most of their time and effort earning a living and taking care of their physical affairs.  <strong>By the end of their careers, this is where their treasure is, and where their hearts are.  God only owns a tiny corner of their hearts.</strong>  If they had spent most of their effort seeking the kingdom of God and His righteousness, they would love God’s kingdom with all their hearts.</p>
<h5 id="22-the-eye-is-the-lamp-of-the-body-so-then-if-your-eye-is-clear-your-whole-body-will-be-full-of-light-23-but-if-your-eye-is-bad-your-whole-body-will-be-full-of-darkness-if-then-the-light-that-is-in-you-is-darkness-how-great-is-the-darkness">22 “The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. <em>If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</em></h5>
<p><strong>A good eye is an eye that looks at things that are pure and genuinely worth focusing your attention on.</strong>  A bad eye is an eye focused on things that are not pure and not genuinely good, things the devil would have us focus our attention on.  If your attention is usually focused on things that are bad, how great is the darkness in you.  <strong>We should focus our attention on heavenly things instead of on money.</strong>  <strong>The kind of treasure we acquire is determined by what we focus our attention on.</strong>  The things we ultimately love are determined by <strong>what we focus our attention on.</strong></p>
<h5 id="24-no-one-can-serve-two-masters-for-either-he-will-hate-the-one-and-love-the-other-or-he-will-be-devoted-to-one-and-despise-the-other-you-cannot-serve-god-and-wealth">24 “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. <em>You cannot serve God and  wealth.</em></h5>
<p>Notice the word <strong>“serve”</strong> in this verse.  Suppose your boss at work asks you to dump toxic waste in the river.  If you are serving wealth, you will go ahead and do it.  If you are serving God, you will risk your job by refusing to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Suppose you are at lunch with several colleagues from work, and they invite you to go to happy hour with them after work for drinking.</strong>  Suppose you are a salesman and need to lie to your customers about your product, or deceive them in some way, to make enough sales.  <strong>Suppose you put so much time and effort into your work that you don’t have time to seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Life will force you to make a decision about what you are really going to serve.</strong> God is watching you always, and He cannot be fooled.  He even knows your thoughts.  <strong>He will know which decision you have made.</strong>  If you have decided you want things of the world more than you want God and righteousness, you have committed yourself to a life that will separate you from God.  <strong>You can have money, but you cannot serve it.</strong></p>
<h5 id="25-for-this-reason-i-say-to-you-do-not-be-worried-about-your-life-as-to-what-you-will-eat-or-what-you-will-drink-nor-for-your-body-as-to-what-you-will-put-on-is-not-life-more-than-food-and-the-body-more-than-clothing-26-look-at-the-birds-of-the-air-that-they-do-not-sow-nor-reap-nor-gather-into-barns-and-yet-your-heavenly-father-feeds-them-are-you-not-worth-much-more-than-they-27-and-who-of-you-by-being-worried-can-add-a-single-hour-to-his-life-28-and-why-are-you-worried-about-clothing-observe-how-the-lilies-of-the-field-grow-they-do-not-toil-nor-do-they-spin-29-yet-i-say-to-you-that-not-even-solomon-in-all-his-glory-clothed-himself-like-one-of-these">25 “<em>For this reason</em> I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. <em>Are you not worth much more than they?</em> 27 And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life? 28 And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, 29 yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.</h5>

<h5 id="30-but-if-god-so-clothes-the-grass-of-the-field-which-is-alive-today-and-tomorrow-is-thrown-into-the-furnace-will-he-not-much-more-clothe-you-you-of-little-faith-31-do-not-worry-then-saying-what-will-we-eat-or-what-will-we-drink-or-what-will-we-wear-for-clothing-32-for-the-gentiles-eagerly-seek-all-these-things-for-your-heavenly-father-knows-that-you-need-all-these-things">30 <em>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, <strong>will He not much more clothe you?</strong></em> You of little faith! <strong>31 Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’ 32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</strong></h5>

<h5 id="33-but-seek-first-his-kingdom-and-his-righteousness-and-all-these-things-will-be-added-to-you"><strong>33 <em>But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</em></strong></h5>

<p><strong>This is one of the most amazing promises in the bible.</strong>  It is also one of the most revealing of the relationship God wants with us.  <em>Jesus said that if we seek first God’s kingdom and His righteousness, God will provide all of our material needs!</em>  This is amazing!</p>

<p>Being a Christian is a very intense and intimate relationship with God!  <strong>It’s intense because we are seeking God’s kingdom and His righteousness more than we are seeking our own material welfare.  We are depending on God for our welfare.</strong>  It’s intimate because God is so involved in the details of our personal lives.  <strong>It’s also intimate because we love God this much and He loves us back!</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of important things to note.  <strong>First, Jesus did not mean that we should quit our jobs.</strong>  The Apostle Paul made tents to provide for his own welfare. (Acts 18:2-3)  <strong>When a Christian needs money, the most common way God provides it is by helping him find a suitable job.</strong>  Most Christians spend part of their time earning money, but they do not <strong>serve</strong> their jobs.  <strong>When decisions have to be made between serving God and money, they serve God.</strong> They trust God for their material needs. <strong>They love God more than anything else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Second, God’s promise that He will provide all of our material needs if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness is the cure for poverty.</strong>  If someone in poverty will truly give his heart to God, then God will supply his material needs.  <strong>At first God may supply them through the church, but in most cases He will eventually provide the new believer with provision that does not depend on charity.</strong>  He may provide non charity support immediately.</p>
<h5 id="34-so-do-not-worry-about-tomorrow-for-tomorrow-will-care-for-itself-each-day-has-enough-trouble-of-its-own">34 “So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</h5>
<p><strong>Even if I have enough money for my present needs, I may worry that I won’t have enough in the future.</strong>  This will tempt me to seek money more than I seek God.  In verse 34, Jesus warns us to not succumb to this temptation.</p>

<h3 id="judging-others">Judging Others</h3>

<h5 id="1-do-not-judge-so-that-you-will-not-be-judged-2-for-in-the-way-you-judge-you-will-be-judged-and-by-your-standard-of-measure-it-will-be-measured-to-you">​1 “Do not judge so that you will not be judged. 2 For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and  by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.</h5>

<h5 id="3-why-do-you-look-at-the-speck-that-is-in-your-brothers-eye-but-do-not-notice-the-log-that-is-in-your-own-eye-4-or-how-can-you-say-to-your-brother-let-me-take-the-speck-out-of-your-eye-and-behold-the-log-is-in-your-own-eye-5-you-hypocrite-first-take-the-log-out-of-your-own-eye-and-then-you-will-see-clearly-to-take-the-speck-out-of-your-brothers-eye">3 Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, <em>but do not notice</em> the log that is in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.</h5>
<p>Jesus said in the Lord’s prayer that God will not forgive our sins if we don’t forgive people who sin against us.  Mat 7:1-2 is similar.  <strong>Jesus said that however I judge other people, I will be judged by the same standard.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In verses 3-5, Jesus said that we don’t even see most of our own sins!</strong>  This means that we are much more in danger of being judged than we realize.  <strong>Jesus said that I probably have much worse sins in my own life than the sin I am judging in yours!  He says I don’t even see the bad sins in my own life!</strong></p>

<p><strong>This would be very surprising and hard to believe if we had not already studied the deceitfulness of sin, the ways we avoid seeing our own sins.</strong>  Remember the story of John Newton, who wrote the hymn <em>Amazing Grace.</em>  Most people have difficulty understanding this passage because they are not aware of the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<h5 id="6-do-not-give-what-is-holy-to-dogs-and-do-not-throw-your-pearls-before-swine-or-they-will-trample-them-under-their-feet-and-turn-and-tear-you-to-pieces">6 “Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</h5>
<p><strong>New Christians, who are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, want other people to know that they need to be righteous too.  It’s only natural.</strong>  In verses 1-5, Jesus warned us not to judge other Christian’s sins so that our own undiscerned sins will not be judged.</p>

<p><strong>In verse 6, He warns us that some non Christians will persecute us for preaching to them.</strong>  We must be a city on a hill and show our light to the world, but we must also have the wisdom to not persist in preaching to people who will only persecute us for it!  We should ask the Lord for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="prayer-promises">Prayer Promises</h3>

<h5 id="7-ask-and-it-will-be-given-to-you-seek-and-you-will-find-knock-and-it-will-be-opened-to-you-8-for-everyone-who-asks-receives-and-he-who-seeks-finds-and-to-him-who-knocks-it-will-be-opened-9-or-what-man-is-there-among-you-who-when-his-son-asks-for-a-loaf-will-give-him-a-stone-10-or-if-he-asks-for-a-fish-he-will-not-give-him-a-snake-will-he-11-if-you-then-being-evil-know-how-to-give-good-gifts-to-your-children-how-much-more-will-your-father-who-is-in-heaven-give-what-is-good-to-those-who-ask-him">7 “ Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!</h5>

<p><strong>This amazing prayer promise is still in the context of “<em>Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</em>”  The promise only belongs to those who are seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p>Even having noted the prerequisite for the promise, the promise is amazing.  <strong>We don’t even need to worry that we are asking for the wrong thing.  Jesus said to just go ahead and ask.  God won’t give us anything that’s bad.</strong>  If we ask for a bad thing, God won’t give it to us.  Recall that God is treating us as His children, and parents often have to say no to their children’s requests.</p>

<p>This passage is kind of similar to James 4:2-3,  “<em>2 You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. <strong>You do not have because you do not ask God.</strong> 3 When you ask, <strong>you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives,</strong> that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.</em>”  <strong>Their motives are wrong because they are not seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>God is not stingy.  In the old testament, God made the righteous rich. (Deuteronomy 28:1-68).</strong>  God’s heart toward people now is the same as it was then.  God’s ability to provide nice things for us is also still the same.</p>

<p><strong>The main difference in the new testament is that God is teaching us to have good hearts.  He insists that we seek His kingdom and His righteousness more than we seek wealth.</strong>  We cannot serve two masters.  This does not usually require us to live in or near poverty, although in some circumstances it may.  <strong>God’s heart in Mat 7:7-11 is that God will provide for us nicely if we are seeking first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  <strong>Jesus addressed this issue in Mark 10:17-31.</strong></p>
<h5 id="12-in-everything-therefore-treat-people-the-same-way-you-want-them-to-treat-you-for-this-is-the-law-and-the-prophets">12 “In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</h5>

<p>Treat people well, without fear, because God is providing for you.  <strong>You don’t <em>need</em> to be selfish.  You don’t need to try to fool them or take things from them.  Most of the motives for not showing people love are removed, because our own needs are so well taken care of.</strong>  God is answering all of our prayers, except when we ask for something we shouldn’t have.</p>
