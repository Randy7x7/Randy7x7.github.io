    <h1>God's Promises and Commandments</h1>
    <main>
      <p><strong>Both the old and new testaments are filled with promises that God will provide abundantly for us if we will seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  The old testament is also filled with commandments that we must keep to be in right relationship with God.</p>

<p>The new testament is filled with moral teachings which Jesus warned us strongly we must keep.  They are not rigid laws with specified penalties, like in the old testament, but Jesus warned us that we must abide by them.  <strong>For simplicity, these moral teachings will be referred to here as commandments also.</strong></p>

<p><strong>God promises to provide all of our material needs and all of our spiritual needs if we will seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  God is not stingy and He is not poor.  He has said that we are His children!  God will provide for our needs abundantly instead of poorly.  He is a good Father.</p>

<p><strong>If a Christian seeks out God’s promises in the bible and spends a great deal of time thinking about them and meditating on them, he will grow to love God and trust Him.  His faith in God will become strong.</strong>  When he loves God and trusts Him a lot, he will try hard to do the things Jesus told him to do.  <strong>Since he loves God, trusts Him, and is trying hard to do the things Jesus said to do, God will fill him with the Holy Spirit and he will be a strong Christian!</strong></p>

<p><strong>If a Christian seeks out Jesus’ commandments in the new testament, meditates on them, and prays about them, wonderful things will happen.</strong>  He will gradually come to understand why they are necessary and how they apply in his life.  Also, God will gradually give him the understanding and power he needs to apply them.  <strong>Because he is really keeping Jesus’ commandments in his heart and life, God will fill him very full of the Holy Spirit.  He will be a strong Christian.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most Christians are weak because they do not diligently seek out God’s promises and commands and apply them to their own lives.</strong>  It is uncomfortable to spend time meditating on God’s commands and talking to God about them, <strong>unless I am willing to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong>  I will of course also need the Holy Spirit’s help to apply them, because of the weakness of my flesh.  <strong>God will give me this help when He sees I am fully seeking Him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most people also don’t spend time seeking out God’s promises and meditating on them.  The reasons for this are complicated.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Most people don’t understand that God’s promises are only available if they are genuinely seeking <em>first</em> God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong>  Therefore, they are disappointed when God doesn’t seem to keep His promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are not aware of their undiscerned sins.</strong>  Therefore, they are disappointed when God doesn’t seem to keep His promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>They don’t understand that we are like children compared to God, and often want things that would not really be good for us.  God will only give us good things.</strong>  Therefore, they are disappointed when God does not seem to keep His promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many people interpret scripture wrong.  They interpret it as if every statement by God was part of a legal document or like a law of nature.</strong>  The new testament was written in a <strong>conversational</strong> style instead of a <strong>legal</strong> or <strong>scientific</strong> style.</p>

    <p><strong>A law in a legal document must note all of the exceptions and prerequisites of the law.  People do not talk that way in conversation.</strong>  Noting all of the possible exceptions and complications of every statement would <strong>slow conversation down to a crawl.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The new testament is the same way.  Every statement in it is essentially true, but there may be exceptions or complications.</strong>  These may be explored elsewhere in scripture.  <strong>It’s a good general rule that every verse in scripture should be interpreted in light of the rest of scripture.</strong> This simple rule eliminates most apparent impossibilities and inconsistencies in scripture, and it leads to the correct interpretations of God’s promises and commandments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For all of these reason’s people’s faith in God’s promises is small.  <strong>None of this decreases the importance or value of God’s promises for someone who has decided to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong>  For such a person, the promises of God are a <strong>treasure chest!</strong>  They are a source of provision in life, and continuing joy and wonder.  <strong>God’s promises, rightly understood, are true and can be fully relied upon if you are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p>The promises of God are a Christian’s power source, both in the physical and spiritual worlds.  <strong>Seeking out God’s promises and meditating on them frequently will enormously increase your faith and victory in all areas of life.</strong>  Please do not miss this key to joy and victory in the Christian life.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-gods-promises-and-commandments">Examples of God’s Promises and Commandments</h3>
<p><strong>The following are a few examples of God’s promises and commandments.  All of the promises are true, important for living the Christian life, and can be relied upon completely.  Obeying <em>all</em> of the commands is truly essential for a victorious Christian life.</strong>  God will help you if you really try.  Remember to depend upon His promises.</p>

<p>In the sermon on the mount, Jesus taught that <strong>we cannot serve both God and money.</strong></p>
<h4 id="mat-624"><strong>Mat 6:24</strong></h4>
<h5 id="24-no-one-can-serve-two-masters-for-either-he-will-hate-the-one-and-love-the-other-or-he-will-be-devoted-to-one-and-despise-the-other-you-cannot-serve-god-and-wealth">24 “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. <strong>You cannot serve God and  wealth.</strong></h5>

<p>You can usually have both God and money, but you cannot serve both.  <strong>You must not devote your life to maximizing your wealth.  You must devote your life to God.  You must always prioritize serving God over acquiring money.  This is a commandment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In Mat 6:33, Jesus promised that God will provide our material needs if we seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness!</strong>  Since God will provide our material needs, we can safely seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.  <strong>God’s promises make it safe for us to obey His commandments.</strong></p>
<h4 id="mat-631-33"><strong>Mat 6:31-33</strong></h4>
<h5 id="31-do-not-worry-then-saying-what-will-we-eat-or-what-will-we-drink-or-what-will-we-wear-for-clothing-32-for-the-gentiles-eagerly-seek-all-these-things-for-your-heavenly-father-knows-that-you-need-all-these-things">31 Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’ 32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</h5>
<h5 id="33-but-seek-first-his-kingdom-and-his-righteousness-and-all-these-things-will-be-added-to-you"><strong>33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Notice that God’s promise to provide our material needs has a prerequisite.  We must seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most of God’s promises have this as an implicit prerequisite.</strong>  Most of His promises are only for His children, and <strong>God’s children are those who are being led by the Holy Spirit. (Rom 8:12-14)</strong>  People being led by the Holy Spirit are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</p>
<h4 id="rom-812-14"><strong>Rom 8:12-14</strong></h4>
<h5 id="12-so-then-brethren-we-are-under-obligation-not-to-the-flesh-to-live-according-to-the-flesh-13-for-if-you-are-living-according-to-the-flesh-you-must-die-but-if-by-the-spirit-you-are-putting-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body-you-will-live-14-for-all-who-are-being-led-by-the-spirit-of-god-these-are-sons-of-god">12 So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh— 13 for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 <strong>For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>In Mat 7:1-5, Jesus warned us not to judge other people.  We are to love other people, not judge them.  Not judging people is a commandment.</strong></p>
<h4 id="mat-71-5"><strong>Mat 7:1-5</strong></h4>
<h5 id="1-do-not-judge-so-that-you-will-not-be-judged-2-for-in-the-way-you-judge-you-will-be-judged-and-by-your-standard-of-measure-it-will-be-measured-to-you"><strong>1 Do not judge so that you will not be judged. 2 For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and  by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.</strong></h5>

<h5 id="3-why-do-you-look-at-the-speck-that-is-in-your-brothers-eye-but-do-not-notice-the-log-that-is-in-your-own-eye-4-or-how-can-you-say-to-your-brother-let-me-take-the-speck-out-of-your-eye-and-behold-the-log-is-in-your-own-eye-5-you-hypocrite-first-take-the-log-out-of-your-own-eye-and-then-you-will-see-clearly-to-take-the-speck-out-of-your-brothers-eye"><strong>3 Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, <em>but do not notice</em> the log that is in your own eye?</strong> 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye? 5 <strong>You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.</strong></h5>

<p>Jesus said in the Lord’s prayer that God will not forgive our sins if we don’t forgive people who sin against us.  Mat 7:1-2 is similar.  <strong>Jesus said that however I judge other people, I will be judged by the same standard.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In verses 3-5, Jesus said that we don’t even see most of our own sins!</strong>  This means that we are much more in danger of being judged than we realize.  <strong>Jesus said that I probably have much worse sins in my own life than the sin I am judging in yours!  He says I don’t even see the bad sins in my own life!</strong></p>

<p><strong>This would be very surprising and hard to believe if we had not already studied the deceitfulness of sin, the ways we avoid seeing our own sins.</strong>  Remember the story of John Newton, who wrote the hymn <em>Amazing Grace.</em>  Most people have difficulty understanding this passage because they are not aware of the deceitfulness of sin.</p>

<p><strong>In Mat 7:7-11, Jesus promised God’s children that God would answer their prayers!  This is an amazing promise!  It seems too good to be true.</strong>  It sounds like Jesus was saying that God is a magic genie.</p>
<h4 id="mat-77-11"><strong>Mat 7:7-11</strong></h4>
<h5 id="7-ask-and-it-will-be-given-to-you-seek-and-you-will-find-knock-and-it-will-be-opened-to-you-8-for-everyone-who-asks-receives-and-he-who-seeks-finds-and-to-him-who-knocks-it-will-be-opened-9-or-what-man-is-there-among-you-who-when-his-son-asks-for-a-loaf-will-give-him-a-stone-10-or-if-he-asks-for-a-fish-he-will-not-give-him-a-snake-will-he-11-if-you-then-being-evil-know-how-to-give-good-gifts-to-your-children-how-much-more-will-your-father-who-is-in-heaven-give-what-is-good-to-those-who-ask-him"><strong>7 Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</strong> 9 Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? <strong>11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give <em>what is good</em> to those who ask Him!</strong></h5>

<p><strong>This promise is clearly addressed only to God’s children,</strong> those who are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.  Also, God only promises to give <strong>what is good</strong> to those who ask.  When a parent walks through a toy store with his children, they are likely to ask for many things the parent judges it would not be good to give them at this time.</p>

<p><strong>God is vastly more intelligent and knowledgeable than we are.  We are like small children to Him.  When we ask Him for something, He looks at our hearts and sees the core need we are trying to get met.  He gives us what will actually work best in our lives.</strong>  This may or may not be what we asked for.  <strong>He may also see that the answer will have to be delayed for one reason or another.</strong>  If we are praying with a bad motive, God may simply say no.  <strong>In this case, we are not seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When we pray, unless we are praying with wrong motives, God will always give us either what we asked for or something better than what we asked for.</strong>
This promise is only for those who are seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>In John 14:15-26, Jesus promised that God will give the Holy Spirit to those who love Jesus enough to keep His commandments.</strong> (verse 15)  These are the people who have faith in Jesus, and they are also the people who are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>James 1:5-8 promises that God will give wisdom to anyone who asks for it.</strong>  He warns that the person asking God for wisdom must be seeking first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness.</p>

<p>A double minded man is one who is not seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>Philippians 4:6-7 promises that God will give us peace when we pray about anything that is making us anxious.</strong>  We should pray with thanksgiving so that our prayer will be filled with faith in God’s provision instead of with worry.<br />
<strong>We must be seeking first God’s kingdom and His righteousness, or we cannot be sure of our prayer being answered.</strong></p>
