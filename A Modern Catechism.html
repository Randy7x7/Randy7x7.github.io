      <h3 id="our-relationship-with-god">Our Relationship with God</h3>
<p>The relationship God has with Christians is described in the new testament.  It is called the <strong><em>new covenant</em></strong>.  The relationship God had with the Jewish people in the old testament is called the <strong><em>old covenant</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The new covenant is very different from the old covenant.  <strong>The following scriptures describe the old covenant.</strong></p>

<p>The Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 5:7-21)
The Blessings and Curses of the Old Covenant (Deuteronomy 28:1-68)</p>

<p><strong>Does anything in these old covenant scriptures catch your attention or surprise you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Old Covenant Failed!  See Hosea 11:1-7.</strong>
The old covenant offered many blessings, but people were too sinful to live up to God’s requirements.  Because of their sins, God sent the people of Israel into bondage in Babylon.</p>

<p><strong>Paul said in Rom 3:20 that we are all too sinful to really keep the law.  The law just makes us aware of our sin.</strong>  We will see more details on this later.</p>

<p>The new covenant is very different from the old.  <strong>In the old covenant, God gave the people a set of laws to obey, and specified the penalty for breaking each law.</strong>   This is the same as the relationship a citizen of the United States has with the government.  <strong>In the New Covenant, God is our Father and we are His Sons and Daughters!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What are some ways in which a parent child relationship is different from the old covenant?</strong>  (Maybe make a list on a white board)</p>

<p><strong>The new covenant is different from the old covenant in two main ways.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The new covenant is a parent child relationship.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>In the new covenant, God sends His Holy Spirit to live inside of us, teach us, strengthen us, and guide us.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The following scriptures describe the new covenant relationship God offers us.</strong>  Some refer mostly to our parent child relationship with God under the new covenant.  Some refer mostly to the role of the Holy Spirit in our lives under the new covenant.  And, some refer to both.</p>

<p><strong>Offer lots of time for discussing these scriptures, and encourage discussion.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The new covenant was prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31-34.</strong></p>

<h3 id="some-ways-in-which-gods-holy-spirit-speaks-to-us">Some Ways in which God’s Holy Spirit Speaks to Us</h3>
<p>A parent must be able to speak to his children.  If God is my Father, He must be able to speak to me.  God speaks directly into my mind by The Holy Spirit. <strong>Rom 8:12-17 and Gal 5:16-26 warn us that we must listen to the Holy Spirit’s voice and do what the Holy Spirit tells us to do.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This raises the question, “How does the Holy Spirit speak to me?  With what kind of voice?</strong></p>

<p>Since God speaks directly into our minds, His Spirit can speak to us in lots of different ways, <strong>not just in words or images.</strong>  The most powerful way He speaks is by <strong>giving us better desires and emotions!</strong> (Gal 5:17 NLT)  Before I was born again of the Holy Spirit, I would have gotten no joy from praising God.  <strong>If you asked me whether I enjoyed praising God, I would have been puzzled about why anyone would think praising God was fun.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After I was born again of the Spirit, I loved praising God more than anything else in the world!</strong>  45 years later, that is still true!  The Holy Spirit living in me gives me joy when I praise God!  The Holy Spirit gives me love for God and for godly things.  I love godly people and places.  God leads us toward good things and away from bad things by giving us appropriate emotions.  <strong>After I was born again, scripture verses would jump out at me and burn in my heart.</strong>
This never happened before I was born again of the Spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Has anyone here experienced this kind of thing?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Although God gives us good desires, he does not remove our natural desires.</strong>
The good desires God gives us often come in conflict with the emotions our natural brains (our flesh) give us.  <strong>We must choose of our own will to follow the Spirit instead of our own flesh.</strong>  God will not make us slaves.  We must choose to follow Him.</p>

<p><strong>Many times, the voice of God is indistinguishable from the voice of conscience.</strong>  When your conscience tells you to do something, you don’t hear a voice telling you to do it.  You just know that you should do it.  God often speaks to us in the same way.  <strong>You just know what’s right or wrong, and you must <em>choose</em> to do right.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes you’ll experience a <strong>burden</strong> to do something, or a <strong>check in your spirit</strong> that you shouldn’t do it.</p>

<p>God also speaks to us in many other ways.  He sometimes gives people visions or dreams.  He sometimes gives us good ideas, or understanding of a problem or situation.  Occasionally, He will speak to someone in an audible voice.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have any questions or comments about how Jesus speaks to us through the Holy Spirit?  Have you experienced the Holy Spirit speaking to you in any of these ways?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The voice of the Holy Spirit becomes much stronger after receiving the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>

<h3 id="jesus-teaching-about-righteousness">Jesus’ Teaching About Righteousness</h3>
<p>Suppose you were considering adopting a child.  <strong>Would you adopt a child you knew would behave badly,</strong> would treat your family badly, and grow up to be a criminal?  God feels the same way.  He will only adopt children who will trust Him and will try hard to behave well.  <strong>God’s children are not under law, but they must try hard to behave the way God tells them to behave.</strong>  Your relationship with God will suffer when you are behaving badly.</p>

<p><strong>As human beings, we are much more prone to deceiving ourselves about the righteousness of our actions and our motives than we realize.</strong>  It has been said that man is not a rational creature, but a rationalizing creature. Because of this, <strong>we are unaware of most of the sin in our lives!</strong></p>

<p>Before we begin discussing Jesus’ teaching on righteousness, we will spend some time examining the deceitfulness of sin.  <strong>This understanding is nearly essential if we are to understand the hold sin has on our lives!</strong>  It’s also essential for understanding why God has to place so much emphasis on the problem of sin.  <strong>Our sin is much worse than we imagine, because we don’t see most of it!</strong>  <strong>The following 7 links describe the deceitfulness of sin.  We will read and discuss each link.</strong></p>

<strong>Have you ever suddenly had the insight that something you do often is sinful?  Revelations of this type are an inevitable part of Christian discipleship.</strong></p>

<strong>Confirmation bias is a major driver of wars and political conflict.  It is also a major driver of divisions within the church universal.</strong>
<strong>If you are a conservative/liberal, do you get almost all of your news from conservative/liberal television channels, newspapers, and web sites?  Do you think this is wise?</strong>
<strong>Do you get most of your theology and understanding of Christianity from one denomination?  Do you think this is wise?</strong></p>

<strong>Can you think of examples of people being blind to their group’s sin or folly?</strong>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhPh4q8WeBDBWb7_PjNJAkxltCNnx5YztTKITcnkaHY/edit?tab=t.0">We Crucified Jesus</a>
<strong>This is a clear example of how our emotions control our thoughts and actions.</strong>  <strong>If we want to think clearly and behave righteously, we must focus more on our hearts than our thoughts or actions!  Proverbs 4:23 says, “Above all else, guard you heart, for everything you do flows from it.” (NIV)</strong></p>

<p><strong>What methods do you routinely use for guarding your heart?</strong></p>

<strong>Do you believe that most of the sin in the world, and in the church, is done by people who do not believe they are sinning!</strong></p>

<p><strong>We will close this session in prayer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The sermon on the mount is Jesus’ first recorded sermon, and His longest recorded sermon.</strong>  It’s recorded in Mat. 5-7.  Parts of it, spoken to a different group of people, are also recorded in Luke.</p>

<p>There was no radio, television, audio recording, newspapers, etc. in Jesus’ day.  <strong>When Jesus started teaching a new group of people, they would not already know His teaching.  He had to start from scratch every time.</strong>  The sermon on the mount may have been repeated, in one form or another, everywhere He went.</p>

<p><strong>Much of the sermon on the mount is about right and wrong ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.</strong>  Jesus teaches many of the principles of righteousness in the sermon on the mount.</p>

<p><strong>We will read the entire sermon on the mount</strong> and examine it in some detail.  It’s only three chapters long, and <strong>the principles it teaches are vitally important to learn well and take to heart.  The quality of one’s Christian life will depend greatly on trying hard to live by the principles taught in the sermon on the mount.</strong></p>
