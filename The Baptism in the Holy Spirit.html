    <h1>The Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h1>
    <main>
      <p>Jesus gave His apostles the Holy Spirit very soon after He was raised from the dead.</p>
<h4 id="john-2019-22"><strong>John 20:19-22</strong></h4>
<h5 id="19-on-the-evening-of-that-first-day-of-the-week-when-the-disciples-were-together-with-the-doors-locked-for-fear-of-the-jewish-leaders-jesus-came-and-stood-among-them-and-said-peace-be-with-you-20-after-he-said-this-he-showed-them-his-hands-and-side-the-disciples-were-overjoyed-when-they-saw-the-lord">19 On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</h5>

As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” <strong>22 And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Jesus had told them in John 16:7 that The Holy Spirit would not come to them unless He died on the cross.</strong></p>
<h4 id="john-167"><strong>John 16:7</strong></h4>

Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</h5>

The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.</h5>

<p>Although Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to His disciples as soon as He was raised from the dead, He told them that they should wait in Jerusalem for a later and much stronger infilling of the Holy Spirit. <strong>He called this stronger infilling a baptism in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<h4 id="acts-11-8"><strong>Acts 1:1-8</strong></h4>
<h5 id="1-in-my-former-book-theophilus-i-wrote-about-all-that-jesus-began-to-do-and-to-teach-2-until-the-day-he-was-taken-up-to-heaven-after-giving-instructions-through-the-holy-spirit-to-the-apostles-he-had-chosen-3-after-his-suffering-he-presented-himself-to-them-and-gave-many-convincing-proofs-that-he-was-alive-he-appeared-to-them-over-a-period-of-forty-days-and-spoke-about-the-kingdom-of-god-4-on-one-occasion-while-he-was-eating-with-them-he-gave-them-this-command-do-not-leave-jerusalem-but-wait-for-the-gift-my-father-promised-which-you-have-heard-me-speak-about-5-for-john-baptized-with-water-but-in-a-few-days-you-will-be-baptized-with-the-holy-spirit">1 In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. <strong>4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. 5 For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”</strong></h5>
<h5 id="6-then-they-gathered-around-him-and-asked-him-lord-are-you-at-this-time-going-to-restore-the-kingdom-to-israel">6 Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”</h5>
<h5 id="7-he-said-to-them-it-is-not-for-you-to-know-the-times-or-dates-the-father-has-set-by-his-own-authority-8-but-you-will-receive-power-when-the-holy-spirit-comes-on-you-and-you-will-be-my-witnesses-in-jerusalem-and-in-all-judea-and-samaria-and-to-the-ends-of-the-earth">7 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. <strong>8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you;</strong> and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</h5>

<p><strong>John the Baptist prophesied that Jesus would baptize people in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<h4 id="john-129-34"><strong>John 1:29-34</strong></h4>

<p><strong>The people waiting and praying in the upper room for the baptism in the Holy Spirit received it on the day of Pentecost.</strong></p>
<h4 id="acts-21-6"><strong>Acts 2:1-6</strong></h4>
<h5 id="1-when-the-day-of-pentecost-came-they-were-all-together-in-one-place-2-suddenly-a-sound-like-the-blowing-of-a-violent-wind-came-from-heaven-and-filled-the-whole-house-where-they-were-sitting-3-they-saw-what-seemed-to-be-tongues-of-fire-that-separated-and-came-to-rest-on-each-of-them-4-all-of-them-were-filled-with-the-holy-spirit-and-began-to-speak-in-other-tongues-as-the-spirit-enabled-them">1 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. 2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <strong>4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.</strong></h5>
<h5 id="5-now-there-were-staying-in-jerusalem-god-fearing-jews-from-every-nation-under-heaven-6-when-they-heard-this-sound-a-crowd-came-together-in-bewilderment-because-each-one-heard-their-own-language-being-spoken">5 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. 6 When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken.</h5>

<p>The crowd was puzzled about how the disciples were able to speak in so many languages. Some thought they were just drunk. Peter stood up and began to explain. <strong>Notice how much more bold and eloquent Peter was than He had ever been before. The baptism in the Holy Spirit changed him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Notice that in verses 38-39 Peter said that the promise of the Holy Spirit, as received at Pentecost, is for all Christians, everywhere and for all generations to come.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When Peter and John found a group of Christians who had not yet received the Holy Spirit, they thought this needed to be corrected.</strong> They prayed for them and then laid hands on them to receive the Holy Spirit. <strong>The apostle Peter and the apostle John clearly thought that Christians need to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>

He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” <strong>5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</strong> 7 There were about twelve men in all.</h5>

<p><strong>It’s clear that the apostles thought every Christian should be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>

<h2 id="-1">…</h2>

<p><strong>In Romans 7, the apostle Paul describes the difficulty of living righteously.</strong> He despairs of ever being able to live righteously! <strong>Paul was probably comparing himself to the standards of Jesus’ teaching in the sermon on the mount, or of his own teaching in 1 Corinthians 13.</strong></p>

Who will set me free from  the body of this death?</strong></h5>

<p>We can all sympathize with this! We know that <strong>all too often we fail to live up to Jesus’ standards of righteousness, or even Paul’s.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The problem is our emotions! We have cravings for many things hard wired into us.</strong> Lust is hard wired into men. All people have strong social instincts. We crave friends and the approval of our friends. We have strong cravings for many of the things money can buy us: food, clothing, a nice house, status, admiration, etc. We are all tempted by anger or fear at times, and we may yield to it.</p>

<p><strong>Our emotions are often too powerful for us. We have willpower, but sometimes the temptation is too strong or lasts for too long. Sometimes a sudden temptation evokes a bad reaction from us before we have time to think about it! Sometimes we begin rationalizing.</strong></p>

<p>The apostle Paul was sometimes beset by sinful emotions which were too strong for him. <strong>In verse 24 he cried out, “Who will set me free from the body of this death?” In Roman 8, he answers this question!</strong></p>

Father!” <strong>16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>God does not take away our old emotions, the emotions generated by our natural biological mind, but He gives us new emotions that we can choose to pay attention to instead. The Holy Spirit gives us new emotions that we did not have before we were filled with the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We still have the option of focusing our attention on the emotions from our biological brain, but we can instead focus our attention on the emotions the Holy Spirit is giving us.</strong> In Paul’s words, we can set our mind on the Spirit instead of the flesh.</p>

<p>Gal 5:16-25 also speaks clearly of this.</p>

Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves. <strong>17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants.

<p><strong>This only works if we can experience strongly the new emotions the Holy Spirit is offering us. Most people cannot experience emotions from the Holy Spirit strongly unless they have been baptized in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most Christians who have been baptized in the Holy Spirit experience great joy when they are in a good prayer meeting or a good worship service. Reading the bible or hearing good preaching can produce the same joy.</strong></p>

<p>I was baptized in the Holy Spirit in 1979. When this happened, <strong>I suddenly loved God with all of my heart.</strong> My love for God was almost overpowering. The fact that there were buildings all over town with crosses on them did something for me. <strong>I was transported by joy just listening to good faith filled Christian songs.</strong> Before I was baptized in the Holy Spirit, I had no hint that such emotions were even possible.</p>

<p><strong>Forty five years later, I still find great joy in prayer meetings and worship services.</strong> The joy God gives me draws me into His service and keeps me there. I start my days with prayer, praise, worship, and bible reading because it prepares me emotionally to greet the day with the joy of the Lord as my strength.</p>

<p><strong>This does not mean that a Spirit baptized Christian never has struggles or spiritual difficulties.</strong>  God does not remove our natural emotions or desires, so we can be tempted to follow them. Also, the felt presence of God’s Spirit fades as our attention is consumed by the day’s affairs. <strong>To the extent that I have any kind of idolatry, I am still in danger.</strong> To the extent that my faith is weak, I am in danger. If I skip prayer, repentance, or worship too long, I am in danger. <strong>I must consciously set my mind on the Spirit by doing the things I know draw me close to God.  I must also always choose to do the things I know God wants me to do.  Otherwise I will grieve the Spirit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Christian who has been baptized in the Holy Spirit can often feel God’s presence in him!</strong>  This is a great faith boost.  <strong>Paul said in Rom 8:16 that the Spirit Himself testifies with our spirits that we are children of God.</strong>  This is a great comfort.</p>
