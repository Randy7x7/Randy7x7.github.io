    <h1>The Relationship God Offers Us</h1>
    <main>
      <h3 id="our-relationship-with-god">Our Relationship with God</h3>
<p>The relationship God has with Christians is described in the new testament.  It is called the <strong><em>new covenant</em></strong>.  The relationship God had with the Jewish people in the old testament is called the <strong><em>old covenant</em></strong>.  The new covenant is very different from the old covenant.</p>

<p><strong>The following scriptures describe the old covenant.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Deuteronomy 5:7-21  (The Ten Commandments)</li>
  <li>Deuteronomy 28:1-68  (The Blessings and Curses of the Old Covenant)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The old covenant was a covenant of laws.  God promised to bless people if they kept His commandments, and to curse them if they did not keep them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Old Covenant Failed!</strong> (Hosea 11:1-7).  It offered many blessings, but people were too sinful to live up to God’s requirements.  Over and over again the people would drift into gross sin.  Because of their sins, God sent the people of Israel into bondage in Babylon.  <strong>Paul said in Rom 3:20 that we are all too sinful to really keep the law.  The law just makes us aware of our sin.</strong>  We will see more details on this later.</p>

<p>The new covenant is very different from the old.  <strong>In the old covenant, God gave the people a set of laws to obey, and specified the penalty for breaking each law.</strong>   This is the same as the relationship a citizen of the United States has with the government.  <strong>In the New Covenant, God is our Father and we are His Sons and Daughters!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What are some ways in which a parent child relationship is different from the old covenant?</strong>  (Maybe make a list on a white board)</p>

<p><strong>The new covenant is different from the old covenant in two main ways.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The new covenant is a parent child relationship.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>In the new covenant, God sends His Holy Spirit to live inside of us, teach us, strengthen us, and guide us.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The following scriptures describe the new covenant relationship God offers us.</strong>  Some refer mostly to our parent child relationship with God under the new covenant.  Some refer mostly to the role of the Holy Spirit in our lives under the new covenant.  And, some refer to both.</p>

<p><strong>The new covenant was prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31-34.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are some important implicit requirements for receiving this promise, which we will look at when we study the sermon on the mount.</strong></p>

<p><strong>John 3:1-8, implies that Christians are born again of His Holy Spirit.</strong>  This is when we are born into God’s family.  Jesus said that we cannot see the kingdom of heaven or enter it unless we are born again of the Spirit.</p>

He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?” 5 Jesus answered, <strong>“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ 8 The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</strong></h5>
