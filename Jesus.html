    <h1>Jesus</h1>
    <main>
      <h3 id="jesus-is-fully-human">Jesus is fully human</h3>
<p><strong>Jesus was a flesh and blood human being.  He was the son of Mary.</strong>  Mary provided 23 of His chromosomes and God provided the father’s half of His chromosomes.  <strong>He was literally the son of God, because God provided the father’s half of His chromosomes.</strong>  He was born as a baby.  <strong>He had to slowly learn to walk and talk, and He interacted as a child with His parents all of the years He was growing up.</strong></p>

<p>When He travelled with His disciples as an adult, His Mother and brothers sometimes came with Him. (John 2:12)  Jesus appears to have had a close personal friendship with Mary, Martha, and their brother Lazarus. (John 11:1-45)  <strong>When Jesus was in the garden of gethsemane just before He went to the cross, He asked God in prayer if there was any way out of it, even though He knew there wasn’t.  This sounds very human.</strong> (Mat 26:36-44)</p>
<h3 id="jesus-relationship-with-god-the-father">Jesus’ Relationship with God the Father</h3>
<p><strong>Jesus said that the Father is greater than Him, so Jesus is distinct from the Father and lesser than Him.</strong> (John 14:28)  <strong>We see this distinctness again in the garden of gethsemane, just before Jesus was taken to be crucified.</strong>  In Luke 22:42, Jesus prayed, “<strong>yet not My will, but Yours be done.</strong>”  <strong>Jesus and the Father had distinct wills at this time, so they were clearly different people!</strong>  Jesus submitted His will to the Father’s will, because the Father is greater.</p>

<h4 id="luke-2241-42"><strong>Luke 22:41-42</strong></h4>
<h5 id="41-and-he-withdrew-from-them-about-a-stones-throw-and-he-knelt-down-and-began-to-pray-42-saying-father-if-you-are-willing-remove-this-cup-from-me-yet-not-my-will-but-yours-be-done">41 And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and began to pray, 42 saying, <strong>“Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.”</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Although Jesus and the Father were distinct, they were nevertheless one!  How can this be?  It’s less of a mystery than it sounds like.  The bible gives sufficient evidence to mostly understand it.</strong>  Although the evidence is clear, it’s somewhat complicated.  <strong>John 14 is a good place to start.</strong>  <strong>John 14 took place during the last supper, the same evening Jesus was taken to be crucified.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most people have difficulty understanding John 14, but it is worth the effort needed to understand it.</strong>  It’s the key to understanding many of the things that puzzle people about the bible.  If you can understand John 14, the rest of the new testament will make good sense to you.</p>

He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10 <em>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. 11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me;</em></strong> otherwise believe because of the works themselves. 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father. 13 Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.</h5>

<p>Jesus said in verse 9, <strong>“He who has seen Me has seen the Father.”</strong>  He explained this in verse 10-11 by saying, <strong>“Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.</strong>  Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me”</p>

<p><strong>The meaning of this passage depends on the meaning of two statements.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The Father is in Jesus because the Holy Spirit is in Jesus.  John the Baptist said in John 3:34 that the Father gave Jesus the Spirit without measure.  The Holy Spirit in Jesus teaches Him and tells Him what to say and do.</p>

<p>Jesus is in the Father because Jesus is part of the Father’s body here on earth.  Jesus did everything on earth the Father told Him to do, just like our bodies do everything we tell them to do.  Jesus is in the Father because He is in the Father’s body.</p>

<p>Jesus said similar things <strong>about us and himself</strong> in the passage below!  <strong>Jesus said that He will be in us and we will be in Him!  The relationship Jesus has with the Father is similar to the relationship we as Christians have with Jesus &amp; the Father.</strong>  When we understand the relationship of Christians with Jesus, we will understand better Jesus’ relationship with the Father.</p>

Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful. 28 You heard that I said to you, ‘I go away, and I will come to you.’ <strong>If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.</strong> 29 Now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. 30 I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me; 31 but <strong>so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me.</strong> Get up, let us go from here.</h5>

<p>The word translated “Helper” in verse 16 is the Greek word <strong>“Paraclete”</strong>, which was the Greek word for lawyer.  In ancient Greece, your lawyer did not speak for you in court.  He stood beside you and whispered in your ear what you were to say or do.  <strong>This is the metaphor Jesus chose for the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit whispers to us what to say and do.  He guides us and teaches us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Holy Spirit tells Jesus what to do, and Jesus always does it.</strong>  John the Baptist said the Father gives Jesus the Spirit without measure. (John 3:34)  <strong>Therefore, the Father is in Jesus telling Him what to do.  Jesus always says and does what the Father tells Him to do, so Jesus is part of the Father’s body.</strong>  Jesus is in the Father.  <strong>The words Jesus spoke and the things He did came from the Father.</strong>  By watching Jesus and listening to Him, one can see what the Father is doing and hear what He is saying.  <strong>Jesus and the Father are one, even though they are separate people!</strong>  Love does that to people!</p>

<p><strong>Christians are to be led by the Holy Spirit, and do what the Spirit tells them to do, functioning as part of the body of Christ.</strong>  Christians are to be one with Jesus in the same way Jesus is one with the Father.</p>

<p><strong>Re-read John 14 with this understanding.  It should mostly make sense now.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are two ways in which Jesus is very different from us.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>He is biologically the son of God!</strong>  The Father provided half of His chromosomes.  Christians are sons and daughters of God, but Jesus is the only <strong>begotten</strong> son of God.  <strong>Rom 8:29 says that Jesus is the first born among many brethren.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jesus is somehow the same as the pre-existent Word</strong> which the Apostle John referred to in John 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have discussed the first of these two ways Jesus is unique, but not the second.  <strong>Now we will discuss the pre-existent Christ, and how Jesus can be fully human and yet also the pre-existent Word.</strong>  Let’s start by looking at scriptures describing the pre-existent Christ.</p>

<p><strong>These scriptures tell us clearly that, somehow or other, Jesus existed before He was born as a human being!</strong>  They also tell us that <strong>the pre-existent Jesus created everything around us, and even created us!  They say that God the Father created things through Jesus instead of directly.</strong>  Recall that Gen 1:26 says “Then God said, “Let <strong>Us</strong> make man in <strong>Our</strong> image, according to <strong>Our</strong> likeness.”  <strong>Creation was a joint project, with God the Father working through Jesus.</strong></p>

<p>We’ve already looked at evidence that Jesus in the flesh was extremely human. <strong>Jesus’ genuine humanness is a key part of His atonement for our sins.</strong>  <strong>How could Jesus be a genuine human being, and yet also be the super intelligent all powerful creator of the world?</strong>  How could Jesus have existed long before the earth existed?</p>

<p><strong>These are questions which we cannot answer definitively.  We don’t have the knowledge needed; the bible doesn’t tell us.</strong>  Although we don’t know how this was done, <strong>there is one kind of obvious guess we can make.  God could have just given the human Jesus some memories from the pre-existing Jesus.</strong><br />
<strong>The memories would have to have been simplified so that a merely human mind could comprehend them.</strong>  They would also have to have been extremely abbreviated, because of the incomprehensible amount of detail involved in creating an entire world!</p>

<p><strong>Jesus could have these amazing memories, and yet still be 100% human.  When He died on the cross, He was an entirely genuine human being making this sacrifice for the rest of humanity.</strong></p>
