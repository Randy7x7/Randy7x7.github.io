    <h1>Crucifixion and Atonement</h1>
    <main>
      <p><strong>The crucifixion of Jesus was one of the greatest acts of evil in history!</strong>  We need to start by reviewing what we have already learned about the deceitfulness of sin. Please re-read <a href="Sin and Self Deception.html"><strong>Sin and Self Deception</strong></a> .  Pay special attention to the material under the heading, <strong>We Crucified Jesus.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The crucifixion proved man’s hopeless sinfulness.  At the very same time, the crucifixion proved Jesus’ spectacular righteousness!  The contrast is breath taking!</strong>  Only God could demonstrate both so strikingly at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>God cannot give hopeless sinners eternal life.  If He did, they would bring hell into heaven.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus was fully human, and yet He obeyed God the Father even unto death on a cross!</strong>  He allowed Himself to be tortured to death on a cross to save as many people as possible.  <strong>Jesus thereby proved that it is possible for a human being to be magnificently righteous!</strong>  He proved that humanity might be worth saving, if a way can be found to do so.  <strong>Jesus Himself, a human being, payed an enormous price for our salvation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus had three advantages.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Father gave Him the Spirit without measure.</strong> (John 3:34)</li>
  <li><strong>He was the best of us.</strong>  He had Mary &amp; God for parents.</li>
  <li><strong>He had strong faith in the Father’s wisdom and goodness.</strong>  Therefore, He obeyed even to the point of death on a cross.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Not everyone agreed with crucifying Jesus.  Jesus had followers.</strong>  His followers were <strong>the people who had faith in His wisdom and goodness.</strong> (John 3:15-21)  <strong>Jesus said in John 3:15-21 that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life</strong> and will not be judged.</p>

<p><strong>God can give the Holy Spirit &amp; eternal life to people who have the kind of strong faith in Jesus’ wisdom &amp; goodness that causes them to do whatever Jesus &amp; the Holy Spirit say to do.</strong></p>

<p><strong>John 14:15-26 says that God will give the Holy Spirit to those who love Him enough to obey Him.  The people who love Jesus are the people who have strong faith in His wisdom and goodness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This tells us that if we have strong enough faith in Jesus’s wisdom and goodness to keep His commandments, then He will give us the Holy Spirit to live in us, teach us, and guide us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The word “helper” in verse 16 is the Greek word paraclete, which is the Greek word for lawyer.  In ancient Greece, your lawyer did not speak for you in court.  Instead, he stood beside you and whispered in your ear what you were to say and do.  This is the metaphor Jesus chose for the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If we have strong faith in Jesus’ wisdom and goodness, then He will give us the Holy Spirit to help us and teach us.  This same faith will move us to try hard to keep Jesus’ commandments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Many modern people misinterpret the word “believes” when they are thinking about the bible and salvation.  They fail to give the word “believes” its full meaning.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Believing in Jesus, or having faith in Him, means trusting Him and believing the things He says.  This requires believing He exists and believing He is the son of God, but it also requires much more.</strong>  If I believe in my plumber, it means I believe he is a capable plumber.  It also means I believe he will do a good job on my pipes and charge me fairly.</p>

<p><strong>If a wife believes in her husband, or has faith in him, it means she believes he is capable, wise, and good.  It also means she believes he loves her and will do whatever is best for her.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I believe in Jesus, or have faith in Jesus, it means I believe all of the things He says.  It also means I believe He is wise and good.  If I have faith in Jesus, it means I believe He loves me and will do what is best for me.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I have this kind of faith in Jesus, I will naturally try hard to do the things He says to do.  I will also try hard to think and be the way He says I should think and be.</strong>  Jesus is a teacher, and belief in a teacher is shown by doing what he teaches me to do.</p>

<p><strong>God gives eternal life to people who have faith in Jesus because they naturally love Him and try hard to do the things He says to do.</strong>  They are good on both the inside and the outside!  <strong>As we saw in John 14:15-26, this kind of faith also causes God to give us the Holy Spirit to help us think and behave righteously.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are not as good genetically as Jesus, but when we are raised from the dead we will have spiritual bodies (1 Cor 15:35-44).  We will also have more of the Holy Spirit than we do now (Rom 8:23), which will help us behave more righteously.</strong></p>

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.</strong> 5 I am the vine, you are the branches; <strong>he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6 If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned.</strong> 7 <strong>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</strong> 8 My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so  prove to be My disciples. 9 Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love. 10 <strong>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.</strong> 11 These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.</h5>

<p><strong>This passage immediately follows the John 14 passage we looked at earlier.  Jesus said in John 14 that He will give us the Holy Spirit if we love Him and therefore keep His commandments.</strong>  He said that if we love Him and keep His commandments <strong>He will be in us and we will be in Him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abiding in Jesus means continuing to be a part of His body.  This means  continuing to listen to what He says by the Holy Spirit and His recorded word, and continuing to do the things He says to do.</strong>  Jesus says in John 15 that we must <strong>continue</strong> to love Him and keep His commandments, <strong>or we will start walking into the darkness instead of the light and will be lost!</strong>  To do the things He says, we must listen to what He says by His Spirit and we must recall the things He taught in the written word.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus warns us in John 15 that salvation is a continuing process instead of a one time event.</strong>  We must <strong>continue</strong> to listen to what the Holy Spirit and the written word say, and try hard to do it, or we will walk into the darkness and be lost.  <strong>The gathering up of dead branches and throwing them into the fire takes place at the end of the age instead of immediately. (Mat 13:24-30, the wheat and the tares)</strong>  They are already dead spiritually.</p>

<p><strong>The people who continue to listen to the Holy Spirit and remember Jesus’ written words, and who try to do them, are the people who have faith in Jesus.</strong>  It is really the faith that matters, not the good deeds, but the good deeds are a reliable indicator of who has faith in Jesus.</p>

<p>Gal 5:16-25 is fairly self explanatory.  <strong>If we listen to the Holy Spirit and obey, we will end up filled with love, joy, peace, etc.</strong>  <strong>We will inherit the kingdom of God.</strong>  <strong>If we ignore the voice of the Holy Spirit and do not obey, we will end up filled with darkness and will not inherit the kingdom of God.</strong>  We will have separated ourselves from Jesus and his atonement for our sins.  <strong>How much faith we have in Jesus will determine which way we choose.</strong></p>

Father!” 16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Rom 7:18-20 says that we are unable to live righteously without the help of the Holy Spirit.</strong>  We are slaves to sin.  Rom 8:2 and 8:4-8 say that <strong>people who set their attention on the desires the Holy Spirit gives can be righteous; they become filled with the fruit of the Spirit.</strong>  The word translated flesh in Rom 8-9 is sarx, which means the natural mind and body.  <strong>Being led by the Spirit is the same thing as abiding in Christ.  You are listening to the Spirit and obeying.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rom 8:14 says that those who are being led by the Spirit are the sons of God.  Rom 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit Himself testifies to us that we are children of God!</strong>  The children of God are the people who will inherit the kingdom of God.  They will receive eternal life.</p>
