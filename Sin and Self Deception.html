    <h1>Sin and Self Deception</h1>
    <main>
      <p>Suppose you were considering adopting a child.  <strong>Would you adopt a child you knew would behave badly,</strong> would treat your family badly, and grow up to be a criminal?  God feels the same way.  He will only adopt children who will trust Him and will try hard to behave well.  <strong>God’s children are not under law, but they must try hard to behave the way God tells them to behave.</strong>  Your relationship with God will suffer when you are behaving badly.</p>

<p><strong>As human beings, we are much more prone to deceiving ourselves about the righteousness of our actions and our motives than we realize.</strong>  It has been said that man is not a rational creature, but a rationalizing creature. Because of this, <strong>we are unaware of most of the sin in our lives!</strong></p>

<p>Before we begin discussing Jesus’ teaching on righteousness, we will spend some time examining the deceitfulness of sin.  <strong>This understanding is essential if we are to understand the hold sin has on our lives!</strong>  It’s also essential for understanding why God has to place so much emphasis on the problem of sin.  <strong>Our sin is much worse than we imagine, because we don’t see most of it!</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-deceitfulness-of-sin"><strong>The Deceitfulness of Sin</strong></h3>

<h5 id="every-mans-way-is-right-in-his-own-eyes-prov-212-nas"><strong>Every man’s way is right in his own eyes. (Prov 21:2)</strong> NAS</h5>

<h5 id="the-heart-is-more-deceitful-than-all-else-and-is-desperately-sick-who-can-understand-it-jer-179-nas"><strong>The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it? (Jer 17:9)</strong> NAS</h5>

<p><strong>As human beings, we are much more prone to deceiving ourselves about the righteousness of our actions and our motives than we realize. It has been said that man is not a rational creature, but a rationalizing creature. Because of this, we are unaware of most of the sin in our lives!</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The life of John Newton illustrates this dramatically.</strong> John Newton is the writer of the song, Amazing Grace. Many Christians know that Newton gave his life to God during a tumultuous storm at sea that nearly sank his ship, and that he was a slave trader. Most people assume that when he became a Christian he gave up the slave trade and wrote Amazing Grace.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, he bought slaves and transported them from Africa to America for more than six years after becoming a Christian.</strong> He was captain of his own slave ship for about the last four years. As many as a third of the slaves would die in the hold of the ship during a trip. During an attempted slave insurrection, he tortured some of the slaves to learn the names of others who were part of the plot. (1, 2)</p>

<p><strong>Newton wrote in his journal that he thought the life of a slave ship captain was more favorable than any other “for promoting the life of God in the soul”.</strong> He sat in the cabin of his slave ship studying the Bible, and regularly held religious services for the crew of his ship. Newton wrote in a letter, “There are few moments of my life afford me more real pleasure, than when I am thus attempting the part of a minister to about 25 people.” (3, 4) </p>

<p><strong>His career as a slave ship captain was eventually ended by a seizure that forced him to take up a new line of work.</strong> It was not until after he was no longer making his living in the slave trade that Newton began to see the horror of what he had done.  </p>

<p><strong>When Newton could no longer make his living sailing, he found a job as a “Tide Surveyor”.</strong> The job of a Tide Surveyor was to supervise 50 or 60 men who inspected ships for contraband when they docked. <strong>While working as a Tide Surveyor, Newton decided he wanted to become a minister.</strong> Despite failing to see the evil of the slave trade, John Newton was a very sincere Christian with a tender heart toward God, and was a good intellectual. Before becoming a minister, <strong>he became a good friend of John Wesley and George Whitefield, very famous evangelists of the time.</strong> (5)</p>

<p><strong>Ten years after becoming a Tide Surveyor, Newton succeeded in becoming a minister. He went on to become famous for ministering to the poor, for having a gracious and loving spirit, and for ministering to royalty and to men of high political office. He also became famous for campaigning to outlaw the slave trade in Britain. His writings were very influential in the ultimately successful effort to outlaw the slave trade. (6)</strong></p>

<p>While Newton was ministering to the poor in the city of Olney, he wrote the following in a published letter to the people of Olney, <strong>“He has placed me amongst you, that if I only pass you in the street, you may have a proof before your eyes of His gracious declaration that all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men for the Son of man’s sake.”</strong> (7)</p>

<p><strong>John Newton wrote Amazing Grace when he was 48 years old, nine years after he became Curate of Olney, his first ministry job.</strong> He wrote it to illustrate a sermon on New Years day of 1773. Newton tells his own story in the song’s chorus. Notice particularly the last line, “Was blind, but now I see”. Also notice that <strong>he did not “see” until many years after becoming a Christian.</strong> (8)</p>

<p><strong>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,</strong><br />
<strong>That saved a wretch like me.</strong><br />
<strong>I once was lost but now am found,</strong><br />
<strong>Was blind, but now I see.</strong></p>

<h3 id="more-examples-of-the-deceitfulness-of-sin"><strong>More Examples of the Deceitfulness of Sin</strong></h3>
<p>The following are additional examples of our innate human capacity to deceive ourselves and repress awareness of our sin.</p>

<h6 id="slavery-in-the-united-states"><strong>Slavery in the United States</strong></h6>

<p>The history of the United States provides another striking example of self deception concerning slavery.  What makes this example especially striking is the number of people involved.  Almost the entire population of the Southern half of the United States convinced themselves that slavery is not evil.  Even more, they convinced themselves that slavery was such a great good that it was worth killing other people or dying in a war to preserve it.</p>

<p>The people of the Southern United States were nearly identical genetically to the people in the North.  The only real differences were cultural and historical.  This implies that nearly all Americans are able to deceive themselves this way given sufficient motivation, history, and group support.  This is not a Southern problem, it’s a human problem. This is the way all of us are!</p>

<h6 id="911"><strong>911</strong></h6>

<p>The people who flew airplanes into buildings on September 11 were convinced they were doing it for righteousness sake.  Their religious/political movement calls the United States the great satan.  The true motives of their hearts probably had more to do with anger and hatred than righteousness, but they believed they were doing it for righteousness sake.  They believed in their cause enough that they were willing to die for it.  They chose not to think about the people in the buildings, or perhaps rationalized that they deserved to die because they were Americans.</p>

<h6 id="people-you-know"><strong>People You Know</strong></h6>

<p>Think of people you know who do wrong.  Think of people at work, or in your extended family, or people you are just acquainted with who do wrong.  How many of them believe they are doing wrong?  It really is true that all of a man’s ways are right in his own eyes.</p>

<h6 id="yourself"><strong>Yourself?</strong></h6>

<p>If everyone else is unaware of his or her own sins, do you think you are the exception?</p>

<h3 id="why-can-we-deceive-ourselves-so-well"><strong>Why can We Deceive Ourselves so Well</strong></h3>
<p>How do we deceive ourselves so completely?  The human mind has many more limitations than we realize.  To get a feel for this, let’s begin by looking at our sensory limitations.  <strong>How large an area can you see clearly at one time?</strong></p>

<p>Focus your eyes on one letter in a line of print.  How many letters can you see clearly without moving your eyes?  If you hold your thumb at arms length, your field of sharp vision is only about the size of your thumbnail!  When we glance around a room, we have the feeling that we see it all at once, but this is not true.  We have the illusion of seeing everything at once because we flick our eyes rapidly around the room.  At any one moment, however, we only see a very small region clearly.</p>

<p><strong>Vision is active, not passive; choices are made.</strong>  We only really see those things we choose to look at. A common demonstration in cognitive science classes is to show students a series of slides, about one slide a second.  Part way through the series, students are asked if there was a boat in the last slide. By a show of hands, most students will say there was not a boat in the last slide.  They are then shown the last slide again, and see that there is a very large boat in it, about 1/3 the width of the slide.</p>

<p><strong>All aspects of our thinking are like this.  Consider your thought process.  When you are thinking verbally, with unspoken words passing through your mind, you only think one small thought at a time.  At the end of one thought, you must choose what thought to think next.  Typically, several thoughts will occur to you to think next, and you choose which thought to pursue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You choose which thought to think next based on emotions: pride, fear, money, social acceptance, group loyalties, convenience, passion, lust of the eyes, etc.  We choose to think thoughts that make us feel good about ourselves.  We choose to think thoughts that will make us feel good about the groups we belong to.  We choose thoughts that justify the way we make our living, and the things we do.  We choose thoughts that will help us gain favor with the people important to us.  We choose thoughts that justify what we want to do and excuse us for not doing the things we don’t want to do.  We avoid thoughts that threaten us or our way of life.</strong>  </p>

<p>Psychologists often speak of our ability to repress awareness of things we don’t want to face. Repressing awareness of something is easy.  We just habitually refuse to think or pursue thoughts that would threaten us.  Like with any habit, we get to where we do it without conscious thought; we are not even aware of doing it.  <strong>What thoughts did John Newton habitually repress while he was a slave ship captain?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jesus addressed this issue in</strong> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat+13%3A3-15&amp;version=NLT"><strong>Mat 13:3-15</strong></a><strong>.</strong>  He explained in this passage that many people repress awareness of the truth because they do not want to believe it.  They have ears that do not hear and eyes that do not see because their hearts are hard.  This is a remarkable exposition of practical psychology to have occurred 2000 years ago!</p>

<h3 id="confirmation-bias"><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Just as we choose which thought to think next, we also choose which books to read, which news shows to listen to, which websites to view, which sermons to listen to, etc. Confirmation bias is our tendency to seek out information sources that confirm what we already believe.</strong> We prefer to listen to news shows and read newspapers that agree with what we already believe. We also look at websites, read blogs, read books, etc. that strengthen our existing beliefs. We seldom look for information that disagrees with what we already believe.</p>

<p><strong>After years of listening almost entirely to information sources that confirm what your denomination or political party believes, for example, you know hundreds of reasons why your denomination or political party is right for every one against it.  It becomes effectively impossible for someone to change your mind.</strong>  A new Christian might choose a denomination almost at random, but eventually knows hundreds of reasons why that denomination is right and the others are all wrong!  </p>
<h6 id="examples-of-lopsided-information-sources"><strong>Examples of Lopsided Information Sources</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Imagine you are a citizen of a country that dislikes the United States.</strong> Think about the news stories you see on television and read in news papers. Do you think that you will come to have a misleading view of the United States? Can you think of examples? Consider the way many Muslim countries view the United States or Israel. This is not confirmation bias, because people don’t choose their countries, but it illustrates the results of getting all of one’s news from one viewpoint. </p>

<p><strong>Imagine that you are a citizen of the old South in the days of slavery.</strong> Imagine how many arguments you would have heard “proving” that slavery is not bad and is in fact a good thing. Consider how seldom you would hear arguments against it. <strong>Imagine the personal cost of choosing to not agree with these arguments.</strong> If you disagree but say nothing, your conscience will trouble you. If you say that slavery is evil, you will be extremely unpopular.  Almost everybody chose to believe the arguments and repress their doubts.</p>

<p><strong>If you are a conservative/liberal, do you get almost all of your news from conservative/liberal television channels, newspapers, and web sites?</strong> Do you believe this is wise?  If you are a conservative/liberal, do you find it hard to understand how liberals/conservatives could possibly believe the things they do? Do you find yourself questioning their motives? Why do you think this happens?</p>

<p><strong>Is humility about one’s political beliefs important for Christians? Why?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is humility about one’s denominational beliefs important? Why?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Imagine how different the world would be if confirmation bias was eliminated!  The effect on human life would be huge, almost incalculable.</strong></p>

<h3 id="our-group-instinct"><strong>Our Group Instinct</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Human beings have a very strong group instinct.</strong> We join groups for the mutual support and comfort they provide, and to participate in group activities. Working in groups is a counter weight to individual selfishness, and makes possible large organized activities. Civilization is made possible by groups and group activities.  </p>

<p><strong>There is a dark side to groups of people, however. Disagreeing with one’s group is extremely unpleasant because of the threat of social isolation and disapproval.</strong> Because disapproval by one’s group is so unpleasant, <strong>most people choose not to think thoughts the group might disagree with. Our group’s sins become invisible to us.</strong> This also applies to group beliefs and attitudes that could be classified more as folly than sin.</p>

<p>For this reason, people working in groups commit many sins they would not commit as individuals. This helps explain many of the atrocities committed by nations, companies, and religious groups. </p>

<p><strong>Question:  Can you think of examples of people being blind to their group’s sin or folly?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question:  What groups are you a member of?</strong></p>

<h3 id="we-crucified-jesus"><strong>We Crucified Jesus</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The most important thing to know about the crucifixion of Jesus is that Jesus died to pay the penalty due our sins.</strong>  He died so that we don’t have to.  It appears, however, that this is not the only important thing God accomplished through the crucifixion.  <strong>The crucifixion seems to have also been arranged as a demonstration of the nature and depth of sin in humanity!</strong>  If God wanted to display the depth of sin in humanity, it’s hard to imagine a better demonstration than the crucifixion of Jesus!</p>

<p>Jesus did nothing but good His whole life.  He taught righteousness; He healed the sick and raised the dead; He was gentle, compassionate, and loving.  In the end, He willingly gave His life to save us.  <strong>What was our response when this perfect, loving, and righteous human being appeared in our midst?  We crucified Him!</strong>  We tortured Him to death on a cross in the most painful and cruel manner we could invent!  We crucified the son of God.</p>

<p><strong>Who was it who crucified Him?</strong>  <strong>We, the human race, crucified Him.</strong>  More specifically, the people whom God had specially chosen and taught righteousness crucified Him.  This was a people whom God had spent 1300 years trying to teach righteousness, probably the most righteous people on earth at the time.  <strong>More specifically yet, it was the religious leaders who crucified Him!</strong></p>

<p><strong>How did it come about that the religious leaders of God’s chosen and carefully taught people crucified God’s son?  It came about because humanity was incapable of learning righteousness!</strong>  It came about because the people’s hearts were bad, and they did not want to learn genuine righteousness.  They preferred a false righteousness which allowed them to engage in sin.  <strong>Because they did not love the truth, they chose to not think the thoughts that would have enabled them to understand and embrace it.  They repressed their awareness of the truth so they could continue sinning.  They chose instead to think thoughts that helped them hate Jesus and his teachings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>They crucified Jesus believing they were doing it for righteousness sake!</strong></p>

<p><strong>They were proudly convinced of their superior righteousness even as they were crucifying Jesus.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Bible refers to Jesus as the lamb of God, because He was crucified for our sins just as lambs were sacrificed for sin.</strong> (Lev 7:1-2, John 1:29)  The crucifixion of Jesus was strangely different from the sacrifice of a lamb, however.  Lambs were sacrificed by a priest.  <strong>If the sacrifice of Jesus had been done analogously, then God would have arranged for the high priest to sacrifice Jesus for us in a ceremony.</strong>  We are so used to the story of the crucifixion that we do not realize how strange it is, and in missing the strangeness we miss the point God was making.  <strong>We miss a chance to understand the depth, the nature, and the incurableness of our sin.</strong></p>

<h3 id="consequences"><strong>Consequences</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I cannot free myself from a sin which I do not believe is a sin!  If I have deceived myself about a sin, then I will continue doing that sin the rest of my life, unless God somehow manages to undeceive me.</strong>  Because of this, <strong>most of the sin in the world, and in the church, is done by people who do not believe they are sinning!</strong>  If John Newton had not had the seizure that forced him to give up being a slave ship captain, he might have continued as a slave ship captain the rest of his life.</p>

<p><strong>If I am sinning and do not believe I am sinning, this is called undiscerned sin.  It is impossible to overstate the importance of learning to discern one’s undiscerned sin.</strong>  Most of the suffering in the world is due to people’s undiscerned sins.  Most of the weakness in the church is caused by undiscerned sin.  <strong>Most of the weakness in my own spiritual life is due to my undiscerned sin.</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>A good first step in learning to discern our sin and overcome it is to study Jesus’ teaching on righteousness.</strong>  This will also help us see the pervasiveness of sin. </p>
