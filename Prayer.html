    <h1>Prayer</h1>
    <main>
      <h2 id="making-prayer-a-part-of-the-community-groups">Making Prayer a Part of the Community Groups</h2>

<p>The people in Christ Church’s community groups need more than just teaching to grow spiritually.  They need direct supernatural experience of God through the Holy Spirit.  This only happens through prayer.</p>

<p>The community groups already pray a little, but their prayers are not the kind that transforms the people praying and brings them into direct relationship with God through the Holy Spirit.  Their prayers are mostly just asking god to heal friends and relatives.  These prayers are useful, but they don’t transform the people who pray them.</p>

<h3 id="the-elements-of-effective-prayer">The Elements of Effective Prayer</h3>
<h4 id="praising-god">Praising God</h4>
<p>Prayer should start with praising God and thanking Him.  This builds faith and the right mindset in the people praying.  The resulting faith and godly hearts also encourage the Holy Spirit to manifest His presence in us.  (xxxxx)</p>

<p>We can praise God for His intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, goodness, generosity, self sacrifice, omnipresence and omniscience, abilities, power, love, experience, etc.  We can thank Him for adopting us as His children, for sending Jesus to teach us and die for our sins, for living in us by the Holy Spirit, for providing for us all things pertaining to life and godliness, for teaching us righteousness, for making us new creations in Christ Jesus, etc. (xxxxx)</p>
<h4 id="confession-of-sin">Confession of Sin</h4>
<p>Unconfessed sin blocks the effectiveness of prayer.  Unrepented sin blocks the answers to our prayers.  Unrepented sin also prevents us from wanting to draw near to God.  It blunts our faith.  Prayer meetings should begin with confessing our sins to God and each other, and repenting of our sins.  Confession and repentance must be specific, not general or abstract, to be effective. (xxxxx)</p>
<h4 id="asking-for-the-holy-spirits-help">Asking for the Holy Spirit’s Help</h4>
<p>We need the Holy Spirit’s help to repent of our sins fully.  We also need the Holy Spirit’s help to even discern many of our most damaging sins.  When we are trying hard to discern and repent of our sins, God will give us the Holy Spirit to help us.  (xxxxx)  When we are filled with the Holy Spirit and have good consciences, we will pray much  better.</p>
<h4 id="asking-for-gods-kingdom-to-come">Asking for God’s Kingdom to Come</h4>
<p>Jesus said in the Lord’s Prayer to pray, “<em>Thy kingdom come and thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</em>”  (xxxxx)  God’s will is seldom done on earth.  Jesus said that Satan is the ruler of this world! (xxxxx)  Satan’s will is often done even in the lives of believers and in the church.</p>

<p>Almost everything bad that happens in the world and in the lives of believers is a result of Satan’s manifested schemes.  The work of the church is to take the world away from Satan and bring it into God’s kingdom.</p>

<p>Fighting between husbands and wives or parents and children is not God’s will.  Anger and bitterness between people is not God’s will.  Hunger and destitution are not God’s will.  Idolatry of all kinds is not God’s will.  People dying without knowing God and going to Hell is not God’s will.  All kinds of foolish thinking and behavior are not God’s will.</p>
<h4 id="asking-for-our-daily-needs">Asking for our Daily Needs</h4>
<p>Jesus told us in the Lord’s prayer to ask God to supply our daily needs.  (xxxxx)  He promised us in the sermon on the mount that if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, God will see to it that we have all of our daily needs.  (xxxxx)  James said that we have to ask for them, however.  (xxxxx)</p>

<h3 id="the-lords-prayer">The Lord’s Prayer</h3>

<p>9 “Pray, then, in this way:<br />
<strong>‘Our Father who is in heaven</strong>,<br />
<strong>Hallowed be Your name.</strong><br />
10 ‘Your kingdom come.<br />
Your will be done,<br />
On earth as it is in heaven.<br />
11 ‘Give us this day our daily bread.<br />
12 <strong>‘And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</strong><br />
13 ‘And <strong>do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from  evil.</strong></p>

<p>The Lord’s prayer (Mat 6:9-13) is a good topic outline for prayer.  It includes all but one of the <em>elements of effective prayer</em> listed in the previous section, and includes additional topics in verses 9, 12, &amp; 13.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus told us to address God as our Father when we pray.</strong>  This is very encouraging and faith building because a Father loves his children and takes care of them.  Jesus emphasizes this strongly in Mat 7:11 .  Trusting and obeying God as our Father puts us in the right relationship with Him.  It guides our prayers and empowers them.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus told us to pray Hallowed be Your name.</strong>  This can be taken as meaning we should praise God.  It could also be taken as a request that God cause His name to be Hallowed throughout the Earth.  This is an evangelistic prayer.  If all the people on Earth sincerely praise and honor God, then God’s kingdom will have come on Earth.  It’s a prayer that all people will know how good God is and how powerful He is.</p>

<p>In verse 12 Jesus warned us that <strong>if we don’t forgive people who sin against us, God will not forgive our sins!</strong>  When we pray, we should check our hearts to see if there is anyone we are holding unforgiveness toward.  Unforgiveness will shut down our relationship with God and cripple our prayers.</p>

<p>In verse 13 <strong>Jesus told us to ask God to not lead us into temptation.</strong>  This is a humble prayer.  It acknowledges the weakness of our flesh and asks God to keep us out of unnecessary temptation.  A recovering alcoholic, for instance, should ask God to keep him away from temptations to relapse.  Temptations will still come, but Jesus said we should ask for God’s help so that we will not fail.  1 Cor 10:13 says that God will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can endure.</p>

<h3 id="praying-scripture">Praying Scripture</h3>
<p>Basing one’s prayers directly on scripture can be a very powerful and effective way to pray, but there are some precautions that must be taken.  If one does not understand scripture correctly, mistakes will be made.</p>
<h4 id="promises-and-commands">Promises and Commands</h4>
<p><strong>God’s promises tell us what prayers we can expect God to answer,</strong> and <strong>His moral teachings and commandments tell us what God expects of us as a prerequisite.</strong>  Because of this, God’s promises and commandments are the heart of prayer.  <strong>They also teach us the relationship God wants with us.</strong></p>

<p>Christians should study God’s promises and commandments and memorize them.  <strong>We should meditate on them day and night!</strong>  They should form the heart of our prayer, and of our lives.</p>

<p>For this to work, we must understand the relationship between God’s commands and His promises.  We must understand the prerequisites we must meet to receive God’s promises.  We also need to understand how to interpret the commandments and promises.</p>

<p>There are two basic principles for interpreting scripture commandments and promises which every Christian needs to understand.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Every passage in the new testament should be interpreted in such a way that it does not contradict any other passage.</strong>  [[Interpreting Mat 7.11]], [[Interpreting John 3.16]], and [[Interpreting John 14.12-17]] demonstrate this principle by showing how to apply it to some important new testament promises.  <strong>Every Christian needs to know how to interpret the main commandments and promises in the new testament.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T<strong>he commandments and promises in the new testament are true generally, but are not rigid laws.</strong>  The old covenant was a covenant of laws, but the new covenant is a covenant of relationship with God.  <strong>We are God’s children and He teaches us by telling us in general what He expects of us and what He will do for us.</strong>  He does not consider His teachings to be rigid laws, however.  In any given situation, God does what is best in that situation.  Some people summarize this by saying that God is sovereign.  Since God loves us and is wiser than we are, this is good.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>God often answers a prayer by starting a process which will produce the answer.  In many cases the process is long and slow.  When this happens, we must be prepared to wait and keep praying for however long it takes.  Many people will give up too soon and then wonder why God did not answer their prayers.</p>

<h2 id="oversight">Oversight</h2>

<p>There is an old saying:  You get what you inspect, not what you expect.  Each community group should be visited occasionally by someone to see if it is functioning well.</p>

<h2 id="leadership-training">Leadership Training</h2>

<p>The members of a community group are likely to grow much more spiritually if the leader already possesses the understanding they need to acquire.  Jesus said, “<em>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.</em>”  (Mat 10:24)  He also said, “<em>If a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.</em>” (Mat 15:14)</p>

<p>Although a community group leader does not teach directly, he guides the discussion and participates in it.  In this role, he can easily funnel new understanding into the group over a period of time.  He can’t teach what he himself does not know, however.</p>

<p>Community group leaders should be taught the following topics.</p>
